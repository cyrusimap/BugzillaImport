            <thetext>The thread on mupdate slaves that keeps the local db in sync makes a lot of
commits, really it should only need to commit after every few events, provided
the events are streamed (and we&apos;re not blocking waiting for more).

most of the groundwork for this (making the mboxlist api support transactions)
has been laid, however its unclear how this should actually all be integrated
into mupdate.

currently, cmd_change is called for each update that occurs, this takes the
change, updates the database, and posts an event to each of the waiting threads
for our clients (And signals them).  However, strange results are likely if we
don&apos;t commit the transaction before signaling the other threads.</thetext>
