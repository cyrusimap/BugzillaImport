            <thetext>When using the iPhone to manage folders on the IMAP server, deleting a folder displays the entire DELETED hierarchy within the folderlist, and then allows you to delete already deleted folders resulting in a very strange hierarchy.

Server configured with (main options only):

altnamespace: off (default as not mentioned in imapd.conf)
unixhiersep: on
virtdomains: userid
expunge_mode: delayed
deletedprefix: DELETED
delete_mode: delayed

It&apos;s also part of a traditional murder.

Mailbox used for testing is testtest@controlpaneltest.org.uk

Prior to delete, ctl_mboxlist -d shows:

controlpaneltest.org.uk!user.testtest.Trash	0 fs1 testtest@controlpaneltest.org.uk	lrswipkxtecda	

Deleting the Trash folder results in ctl_mboxlist showing:

controlpaneltest.org.uk!DELETED.user.testtest.Trash.4ED4B366	0 fs1 testtest@controlpaneltest.org.uk	lrswipkxtecda	

This then shows up in the iPhone interface with DELETED at the same level as INBOX. Deleting the 4ED4B366 folder then results in ctl_mboxlist showing:

controlpaneltest.org.uk!DELETED.DELETED.user.testtest.Trash.4ED4B366.4ED4B3C9	0 fs1 testtest@controlpaneltest.org.uk	lrswipkxtecda	


Apparently this should instead have resulted in the deleted folder being instantly deleted. 

Removing access to the mailbox using cyradm

localhost.localdomain&gt; dam DELETED/DELETED/user/testtest/Trash/4ED4B366/4ED4B3C9@controlpaneltest.org.uk testtest@controlpaneltest.org.uk

causes the folder to disappear from the iPhone (as expected)

Enabling telemetry for the user doesn&apos;t show any LIST commands being executed so I&apos;m not too sure how the iPhone is picking up the folders. There are some LSUB commands but even when the folder is unsubscribed it remains showing in the iPhone folder list.</thetext>

            <thetext>Turns out this is an issue when the frontends don&apos;t have delete_mode:delayed but the backends do.

Adding delete_mode:delayed to the frontends in the murder removes the DELETED/ hierarchy from the iPhone view.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed by always suppressing the DELETED heirarchy.  If you happen to be using that name for something else at your site, you can always rename the deleted namespace to an illegal character, e.g. &apos;-&apos;.

This is documented in install-upgrade.html as well.</thetext>
