            <thetext>This can be done by quoting the localpart of the address in lmtpengine.c.  But,
does this break current behavior?  RFC821 is a pain when it comes to sorting 
this out.  Maybe I should look atr RFC2821 to see if its any better.

In the mean time, SP and specials can be escaped when using deliver.</thetext>

            <thetext>This bug bit me too (it&apos;s still an issue with 2.1.0). My suggestion would be 
that the deliver_msg function inside deliver.c should escape the mailbox name 
before it appends it to the username to generate the full name which is then 
passed to the lmtp layer. My reasoning, although I don&apos;t know much about lmtp 
or the code, is that you are just passing an address string through to the lmtp 
delivery layer, and thus its the responsibility of the calling function to 
generate the valid address (including doing necessary escpaing) - it is already 
doing some address construction by appending the mailbox name.

A side comment - should deliver_msg also do escaping where necessary on any 
invalid characters in the username component?

I hacked our local version of deliver to do the escaping with a hack (allocate 
buffer twice the length of the mailbox name, and go over each character in the 
mailbox name and copy it to the buffer, with a backslash in front of it if 
necessary).

            <thetext>Just a quick question - has this been fixed?  I haven&apos;t seen any issues delivering to folders with spaces, and I have lots of them on my testbed these days!  I&apos;d like to close this ticket if so.</thetext>
