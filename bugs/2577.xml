            <thetext>Just installed 2.2.8 on FreeBSD 4.10 (never had an earlier IMAP installed).
The first user&apos;s messages kept reverting to the &quot;unseen&quot; state in the client, 
and the server log contains a lot of

Nov 28 10:50:11 bunter imaps[333]: DBERROR: opening /var/imap/user/r/robin.seen: 
No such file or directory
Nov 28 10:50:11 bunter imaps[333]: DBERROR: opening /var/imap/user/r/robin.seen: 
cyrusdb error

/var/imap existed with right perms, but /var/imap/user did not.  Creating 
/var/imap/user was not sufficient to fix the problem; I had to mkdir 
/var/imap/user/r as well.  I had run mkimap before adding any users.

            <thetext>This is a known problem and is noted as bug #2069.  It hasn&apos;t been touched
because BDB isn&apos;t the default database for *any* of the user meta-data databases
and probably isn&apos;t the best choice, therefore this bug is an edge case IMO.  Can
you explain why you aren&apos;t using the defaults for your databases?

            <thetext>Oh, I should have seen that :)

Note that you will almost certainly be *very sad* if you are using berkeley for
mboxlist on a system of any decent size.</thetext>

There was no installation guidance telling me why I&apos;d prefer one
database over another, so I made them all the same.

&gt; Note that you will almost certainly be *very sad* if you are using
&gt; berkeley for mboxlist on a system of any decent size.

Is there installation guidance somewhere concerning this point?  Or
instructions on how to ditch one database and rebuild with another?
(Not that it&apos;s very important for my case, since I&apos;ll never have even
ten users.)
