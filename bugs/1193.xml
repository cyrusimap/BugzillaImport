            <thetext>I&apos;ve seen more than once a proxyd hang when the AUTHENTICATE command is given to
it from pine.  It appears to send the first token in the Kerberos exchange, but
it never is recieved by pine.  proxyd and pine are then both waiting for input.

It also appears that once a proxyd exhibits this behavior, it will continue to
exhibit it for all future connections.</thetext>

            <thetext>also exhibited very clearly when pine (or imclient, for that matter) is waiting
for an OK to be sent.

So, I added a prot_flush after sending the ok on the off chance that the
prot_setsasl might be mucking it up.  if it goes away, maybe that fixed it.</thetext>

            <thetext>more specifically, killing ptloader released the lock, so someone could have
been connected to ptloader waiting for a response, and released the lock when
ptloader died.</thetext>

            <thetext>final verdict:

seems to be a corrupted ptcache database.  removing the database and
re-initializing it solved the problem.</thetext>

            <thetext>this has started driving me nuts enough that I&apos;m going to try backing out db-4
on the frontends and seeing if it goes away.  also bumping priority to
