            <thetext>I had several issues with current cyrus 2.5 from git on ARM, most of them seemed gone with adding &quot;-fsigned-char&quot; to CFLAGS in the Makefile. 

That&apos;s probably not the best solution (see below), maybe you prefer using uint8_t/int8_t or unsigned char / signed char where appropriate. Most helper documents I&apos;ve found so far are recommending int values in case one wants to compare to EOF et al.

One example is:

In file imap/dlist.c in function dlist_parsemap() there&apos;s a line:
c = dlist_parse(&amp;dl, parsekey, stream);
followed by:
if (c != EOF) 

This check is _always_ false on ARM, because EOF==-1 and c is in range 0-255.

char is unsigned by default on ARM. AFAIK signed char has a performance penalty on ARM, so most compilers use unsigned char by default. Therefore maybe using int on 32/64 bit systems seems better than using char for return values!?</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;ve got an ARM box of my own on the way, which will help debug things like this.

I agree, we should just use the &apos;int&apos; datatype for signed return values.</thetext>

            <thetext>The ARM box will help, make things easier. But you can reproduce things without it. I&apos;ve added some step by step instructions to an other bug (seems fixed now) at the kolab bug tracker using qemu and arm emulation on x86: https://issues.kolab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3791#c2

(there are many guides on how to use arm emulation on x86, this one misses instructions how to install the needed tools like qemu-img, but it includes downloading and compiling cyrus...)</thetext>

            <thetext>git master branch now uses &apos;int&apos; for single characters that might be EOF (a la getc etc), as of commit f507861

Not sure if this is worth back porting to 2.5.  There&apos;s a workaround per hede&apos;s comment, and not many people seem to be running Cyrus on ARM anyway (or at least, they aren&apos;t complaining).  But if someone wants to do the cherry-pick-and-cleanup dance and submit a patch, I&apos;m happy to merge it.</thetext>
