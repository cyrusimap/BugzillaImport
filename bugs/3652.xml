            <thetext>Cyrus has several Perl modules.  When a Perl module is installed,
MakeMaker will install it into one of three locations, known as
&apos;perl&apos;, &apos;vendor&apos; and &apos;site&apos;.  The default is &apos;site&apos;, and because we
do nothing to change it, this is what we get when we install.  However,
this is the wrong location.  According to this advice

https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/hints_for_distributors

we should be using the &apos;vendor&apos; locations.  The trick is to pass
INSTALLDIRS =&gt; &apos;vendor&apos; to MakeMaker.

We also need to change the way we set up the Perl search paths in
the various top-level Perl scripts and shell scripts which invoke
Perl scripts.  Currently this is done in different ways:

In perl/imap/cyradm.sh

INCS=
SITEARCH=&quot;@INSTALLSITEARCH@&quot;
if [ -n &quot;$SITEARCH&quot; -a -d &quot;$SITEARCH&quot; ]; then
    INCS=&quot;-I$SITEARCH&quot;
fi

case &quot;x$BASH_VERSION&quot; in
x) exec perl $INCS -MCyrus::IMAP::Shell -e shell -- ${1+&quot;$@&quot;} ;;
*) exec perl $INCS -MCyrus::IMAP::Shell -e shell -- &quot;$@&quot; ;;

where @INSTALLSITEARCH@ is interpolated by the Makefile at build
time.


In perl/sieve/scripts/installsieve.pl

use lib (&quot;@prefix@/lib/perl&quot;, &quot;@prefix@/share/perl&quot;);

where @prefix@ is interpolated by the Makefile at build
time.

These need to be replaced with something like

use lib (&quot;@INSTALLVENDORLIB@&quot;, &quot;@INSTALLVENDORARCH@&quot;);

This is causing problems on ci.cyrusimap.org, where the &apos;site&apos;
directories on CentOS are sufficiently different from the &apos;site&apos;
directories on Debian so that the value of $PERL5LIB that
Cassandane sets up when it runs the installsieve script,
does not contain the actual locations of the Cyrus modules.

&gt; Cyrus has several Perl modules.  When a Perl module is installed,
&gt; MakeMaker will install it into one of three locations, known as
&gt; &apos;perl&apos;, &apos;vendor&apos; and &apos;site&apos;.  The default is &apos;site&apos;, and because we
&gt; do nothing to change it, this is what we get when we install.  However,
&gt; this is the wrong location.  According to this advice
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; we should be using the &apos;vendor&apos; locations.  The trick is to pass
&gt; INSTALLDIRS =&gt; &apos;vendor&apos; to MakeMaker.
&gt; 

Actually, these are hints for distributors, like Fedora, and Red Hat, and Debian - not hints for a ./configure; make; make install if you will, where &apos;site&apos; should be used.

If you want to specifically install into the vendor directory, use a parameter to Build.PL;

  %{__perl} Build.PL installdirs=vendor

or Makefile.PL;

  %{__perl} Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor

A ./configure; make; make install should default to using &apos;site&apos;.</thetext>

            <thetext>(sigh).

So the situation is...complicated.  I&apos;ve tried to solve the problem
in the simplest way in this commit, but I&apos;m happy to be convinced
there&apos;s a better way.  Let me see if I can explain the actual problem
I was trying to solve.

The main complicating factor comes in when we configure cyrus with
a --prefix option which is not /usr, for example

./configure --prefix=/usr/cyrus-fastmail

We (and by &apos;we&apos; I suspect I mean &apos;only Fastmail&apos;) want to allow two
different cyrus system packages (.debs in our case) to be installed
on a system at the same time, without clashing.  For example, one of
our production machines has these installed:

cyrus-conversations	9:1fmgit21496-7230-05702393
cyrus-fastmail	9:1fmgit23446-7771-665f7a39
cyrus-future	9:1fmgit23446-7771-665f7a39

which install (for example) the imapd binary into, respectively,

/usr/cyrus-conversations/bin/imapd
/usr/cyrus/bin/imapd
/usr/cyrus-future/bin/imapd

Some OS package systems have difficulty handling the case where a
file is owned by two different packages, even if that file has
identical contents.  So to avoid relying on that behaviour, we
need to make sure that every single file installed by a cyrus
package built with --prefix != /usr, is installed into a unique
path which doesn&apos;t clash with the same file installed by another
cyrus package built with a different --prefix.

When our configure script is run, the only information we have to
uniquify our pathnames is the value of --prefix.  So, we achieve
unique paths by putting all the pathnames under the --prefix.

For example:

% dpkg-query -L cyrus-future | grep &apos;^\/usr\/cyrus-future&apos; | wc -l
207

% dpkg-query -L cyrus-future | grep -v &apos;^\/usr\/cyrus-future&apos;
/.
/usr
/usr/share
/usr/share/doc
/usr/share/doc/cyrus-future
/usr/share/doc/cyrus-future/changelog.Debian.gz
/usr/share/doc/cyrus-future/copyright

as you can see, the only files not under the prefix are the ones
built by the package system i.e. entirely outside cyrus&apos; configure
script.

As a consequence, any cyrus package built with prefix != /usr
will be installing Perl modules in directories which are not any
of the six standard system locations.

For example, on that same machine the standard locations are

% perl -V:install.\*
...
installarchlib=&apos;/usr/lib/perl/5.10&apos;;     # &apos;perl&apos; arch-dependent
installprivlib=&apos;/usr/share/perl/5.10&apos;;   # &apos;perl&apos; arch-independent
...
installsitearch=&apos;/usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.1&apos;;   # &apos;site&apos; arch-dependent
installsitelib=&apos;/usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1&apos;;  # &apos;site&apos; arch-independent
...
installvendorarch=&apos;/usr/lib/perl5&apos;;     # &apos;vendor&apos; arch-dependent
installvendorlib=&apos;/usr/share/perl5&apos;;    # &apos;vendor&apos; arch-independent

but the cyrus-future package is installing modules into

/usr/cyrus-future/lib/perl/5.10.1/      # arch-dependent
/usr/cyrus-future/share/perl/5.10.1/    # arch-independent

which are the directories that MakeMaker uses when you run it
with PREFIX=/usr/cyrus-future and INSTALLDIRS=site.

Now, because these modules are in non-standard locations, we need to
do special tricks to find them at runtime, one of

 * perl -I

 * futzing with @INCS

 * use lib (&quot;...&quot;), i.e. futzing with @INCS more cleanly

 * set PERL5LIB in the environment

and we need to do that in every place where we need to load (the correct
versions of) the Cyrus modules.  There are two groups of these

 * perl/imap/cyradm.sh is a shell script which is a trivial wrapper
   around some Perl code in the module Cyrus::IMAP::Shell.  It is
   installed from perl/imap/Makefile.PL which is built using MakeMaker.

 * perl/sieve/scripts/installsieve.pl etc are Perl scripts which use
   the Cyrus::SIEVE::managesieve module.  They are installed from
   perl/sieve/Makefile - which is *not* built using MakeMaker

Both of these get installed into $prefix/bin/.  Because installsieve.pl
is a Perl script rather than a shell script wrapper around a Perl script,
we don&apos;t really have the option of using PERL5LIB in the environment or
the -I option, so basically we end up doing &quot;use lib&quot;.

The old code was doing this

use lib (&quot;@prefix@/lib/perl&quot;, &quot;@prefix@/share/perl&quot;);

with @prefix@ replaced by the value of $prefix at install time, in the
Makefile.  The problem with this is that it assumes a particular directory
structure which is in fact a choice made at the time when the OS vendor
runs Perl&apos;s configure script.  The values hardcoded above worked on Debian,
but don&apos;t work on CentOS, which has

% perl -V:install.\*
...
installarchlib=&apos;/usr/lib64/perl5/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi&apos;;
installprivlib=&apos;/usr/lib/perl5/5.8.8&apos;;
...
installsitearch=&apos;/usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi&apos;;
installsitelib=&apos;/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8&apos;;
...
installvendorarch=&apos;/usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux-thread-multi&apos;;
installvendorlib=&apos;/usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.8&apos;;

This was the problem causing Jenkins builds #452 and #453 to fail.  The
solution I chose was to

 * use the &quot;use lib&quot; technique everywhere, using directories predicted
   at install time expansion

 * force INSTALLDIRS=vendor in the modules&apos; Makefile.PL so that we only
   ever have to deal with two directories in the &quot;use lib&quot;

 * for perl/sieve/Makefile, predict the directories into which MakeMaker
   will end up installing the modules, at configure time using $prefix,
   &apos;perl -V:installvendorlib&apos; and &apos;perl -V:prefix&apos;

 * for perl/imap/Makefile.PL, the directories are available in variables
   set up by MakeMaker.

So there&apos;s a number of ways we could vary this solution.

a) Allow installation into either &apos;vendor&apos; or &apos;site&apos; - then we need to
   predict, expand at install time, and &quot;use lib&quot; on, *four* directories.

b) Similarly, but choose either the 2 vendor directories or the 2 site
   directories depending on whether $prefix = /usr, so we only have to
   expand two directories.

c) Similarly, but have the configure script calculate an entire &quot;use lib...&quot;
   line and expand that at install time

d) At configure time, if $prefix != /usr, choose two installation
   directories for Perl modules (e.g. $prefix/share/perl/ and
   $prefix/lib/perl/), igoring entirely the system Perl&apos;s choice of
   directories, and *force* MakeMaker to install them there.  If
   we force them, there will be exactly two directories and their
   positions relative to $prefix will be completely predictable, so
   only $prefix needs to be expanded at install time.  If $prefix = /usr
   we do none of that, and expect to find Cyrus modules in the standard
   system locations.
   
d) Figure out the directories at runtime instead of configure &amp; install
   time.  The problem with this is that it may mean significant complexity
   at every one of the places in the code where we use a Cyrus Perl
   module. Worse, it&apos;s complexity we couldn&apos;t abstract out into common
   code, because we have the same problem - we don&apos;t know where to find
   the correct version of that common code.

Let me know what you think.</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, I have a new solution which I hope will be better received.

This one does not mandate whether the Cyrus Perl modules are installed
into site or vendor directories, but handles either.  It also handles
running from an uninstalled staging directory, as Cassandane does.
