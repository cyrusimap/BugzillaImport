            <thetext>conforms with latest ACL draft, probably actually necessary to move the graffiti 
tree to be mastered on Cyrus.  (let people do folder creates from IMAP clients, 
but not folder removes.)</thetext>

            <thetext>Any reason why I shouldn&apos;t go ahead and make this change, even though it doesn&apos;t 
appear to be documented anywhere?  I don&apos;t understand the graffiti bit though.</thetext>

            <thetext>graffiti is a tree of bboards on cyrus.andrew (mirrored from our legacy mail 
system).  users are allowed to create new bboards just by sending mail there 
but aren&apos;t allowed to delete them. when we convert them totally to IMAP, we&apos;ll 
probably allow them to create subboards but not delete them via IMAP.

i got some amount of pushback when i suggested this on the list last time from 
people who said &quot;why don&apos;t you wait for the standard&quot;.  the standard has been 
moving very slowly.</thetext>

            <thetext>yeah, the draft is moving slowly (in fact its expired) but we know the change is 
going to happen (probably right before or after the March IETF) so why don&apos;t we 
push on and hope the draft follows.  I&apos;m guessing that there are more people on 
the info-cyrus list complaining about not having the &apos;x&apos; acl than will complain 
about being non-standard.</thetext>

            <thetext>i&apos;ve now made this run-time configurable, defaulting to &quot;c&quot;.
adding &quot;x&quot; should be trivial but i haven&apos;t done that yet.

maybe i should think about doing the right thing, which is &quot;c&quot; on the parent and
&quot;d&quot; on the target mailbox?

            <thetext>moving priority down; now Crispin is complaining about the latest draft.

            <thetext>closing bug, since we&apos;re satisfied with the current behavior, and this really
isn&apos;t an &apos;implement ACL2 already&apos; issue.</thetext>
