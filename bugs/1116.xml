            <thetext>currently these are generated from a Makefile that does some simple substitutions.

it would be nice to do better than this so we can easily modify the
configuration murder-wide and we have less of a chance of making errors,
especially since there&apos;s not much difference between {frontend,backend,smtp}
imapd.conf

cyrus.conf&apos;s are a little trickier, but they also share a lot of similiarity and
so there&apos;s still good chances of modifying one and not the other</thetext>

            <thetext>we also probabally want to unify our local-depot.pref.proto&apos;s, since they should
be exactly the same for the production systems.  (currently the frontends are
running a modified copy of master, so they need a different collection...)</thetext>

            <thetext>imapd.confs have been fixed so this works properly.  I suspect we&apos;ll need to use
a shell script to get the short hostname to authenticate to (~rjs3/bin/forceq
does something similar to what I suspect we&apos;d need) for the cyrus.confs to work.
 I&apos;ll probably start playing with this shortly.

I&apos;ve also moved the imapd.conf out of the host/ directory and into the
respective frontend/ backend/ and smtp/ directories (as appropriate).

mupdate1 is still a special case, but I suspect we can just get rid of the
host-specific directory and move its files into mupdate/

            <thetext>cyrus.conf is cleaned up now, and all the extra directories in
wsadmin/specific/host are now gone (leaving only mail1, mail2, and mupdate1)

on to fix mupdate.</thetext>
