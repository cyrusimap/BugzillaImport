            <thetext>We have two name servers defined in /etc/resolv.conf on our (IMAP) mail server.
We happened to have a situation, where the first of these servers went down and
stopped responding to DNS queries. The other DNS server still worked, so I could
resolve names and addresses on mail server with host or nslookup commands.
However, LMTP TCP service stopped working at this situation. Telnet from another
machine (mail exchanger) to mail server LMTP port didn&apos;t print anything, the
connection just hanged for a while and was ultimately dropped after about an
half a minute. After adding mail exchanger IP address and name to /etc/hosts on
the mail server everthing started working properly again.

Strangely, only LMTP service was affected by the problem. IMAP service still
worked (with notable slowdown, which was expected). Does lmtpd handle reverse
DNS queries somehow different than other components?

Here&apos;s an excerpt from the mail server log file (edited):
Apr 17 04:02:53 puuhapete lmtp[13995]: accepted connection
Apr 17 04:02:56 puuhapete lmtp[13984]: accepted connection
Apr 17 04:02:58 puuhapete lmtp[13995]: connection from laalaa.xxx.xxxxxx.xx
[192.168.x.xxx] preauth&apos;d as postman
Apr 17 04:03:00 puuhapete lmtp[13990]: accepted connection
Apr 17 04:03:01 puuhapete lmtp[13984]: connection from laalaa.xxx.xxxxxx.xx
[192.168.x.xxx] preauth&apos;d as postman
Apr 17 04:03:05 puuhapete lmtp[13990]: connection from laalaa.xxx.xxxxxx.xx
[192.168.x.xxx] preauth&apos;d as postman

There is an about 5 second delay between &quot;accepted connection&quot; and &quot;connection
from [..]&quot; messages. In normal situation, there is virtually no delay. Log print
suggests that the reverse DNS query was successful, but still the connection
hanged (not even the LMTP banner was shown).

Having some more information would be ideal (a backtrace or syscall trace output), otherwise I will 
attempt to simulate this some time later.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hmm. I tried to reproduce the problem, but couldn&apos;t. I changed the first name
server on /etc/resolv.conf to a bogus one (wrong IP address). As expected, DNS
queries slowed down, but this time it didn&apos;t affect lmtpd any other way. LMTP
banner prints out in about 10 secs.

The code snippets show no difference between lmtpd and imapd, as far as I can
see. I wish I&apos;d saved strace output when the problem was at hand...

One possible explanation I can imagine is that maybe LMTP service didn&apos;t reach
any name servers at all. At least, testing this situation gives a similar
non-functionality (no LMTP banner and connection drops after a while). This is
quite strange (because other services on the same server could reach the other
name server while the other was down), but I guess this might not be lmtpd issue
after all.

Since I can&apos;t reproduce this anymore I&apos;ll consider the case to be closed for
now. Sorry to bother you.</thetext>
