            <thetext>Is anyone using cyrus imapd 2.5 (from git) on some ARM machine? I tried to use cyrus-imapd 2.5 on my Kolab on ARM machine (Wandboard with Freescale i.MX6 ARM SoC). Compiling is fine, starting also, but creating mailboxes results in errors and no mailbox created. 

The old 2.4.17-7 (Package Maintainer: Jeroen van Meeuwen) is working fine. 
The new 2.5 doesn&apos;t work. Neither the version compiled from kolab 3.3 
repositories nor directly compiling from git clone.

Whereever I do want to create a mailbox, it doesn&apos;t do so (cyradm, setup-kolab, kolab-webadmin, kolabd). 

With cyradm and &quot;cm&quot; it outputs on the second attempt:
createmailbox: System I/O error
and &quot;lm&quot; lists nothing.

I&apos;ve created two LXC VMs: one on the ARM board and one at my x86 Desktop. 
Both using Debian 7 and cyrus-imapd-2.5-snapshot-autoconf-and-automake-1034-g9704e5d
(git clone git://git.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/)

(((before that I&apos;ve tried cyrus-imapd_2.5~dev2014082101-0~kolab1_armhf.deb
from the kolab sources (http://obs.kolabsys.com:82/Kolab:/...), didn&apos;t work either; for the sake of comparison I did use cyrus-git now:)))

I did:
aclocal -I cmulocal
autoheader
autoconf
at the arm machine and copied the source files to the x86 target.
both using the same &quot;./configure&quot;-line, except &quot;--build arm-linux-gnueabihf&quot;
vs. &quot;--build i386-linux-gnu&quot;. All configured to use /usr/local/ prefix.
 -&gt; make -&gt; make install.   

Same cyrus.conf and imapd.conf.
Both with cleaned /var/lib/imap and /var/spool/imap.

Then I manually started cyrus:
/usr/local/lib/cyrus-imapd/master -M /usr/local/etc/cyrus.conf \
-C /usr/local/etc/imapd.conf  -l 32 -d

And connected via cyradm:
cyradm -u cyrus localhost

but behaviour differs.

at the x86:
#########
root@kolab33test:~# cyradm -u cyrus localhost
Password: 
localhost&gt; lm
localhost&gt; cm mbox1
localhost&gt; lm  
mbox1 (\HasNoChildren)  
localhost&gt; cm mbox1  
createmailbox: Mailbox already exists
#########
looks like normal behaviour.

at the arm:
#########
root@kolab33test:~# cyradm -u cyrus localhost
Password:
localhost&gt; lm
localhost&gt; cm mbox1
localhost&gt; lm
localhost&gt; cm mbox1  
createmailbox: System I/O error
#########
doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s working as it should be.

So even if I compile cyrus-imapd (from git) on a clean Debian 7 the behaviour 
of x86 and arm differs. x86 seems to be fine while arm has some problem/bug.

(btw: even if it&apos;s the same Debian version, both are slightly different. 
On x86 it&apos;s using gcc 4.7.2 while on arm it&apos;s using gcc 4.6.3. 
Maybe that&apos;s the matter?)

I&apos;ve reported this also at issues.kolab.org but I think it&apos;s better to report it upstream because it does concern cyrus and not kolab?

            <thetext>I suppose I&apos;d try running with:

  http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/F20/Installation

which should give you a fully compatible ARM system under QEMU</thetext>

            <thetext>I only have one of those boxes and I need it myself. :-)
(and my money is quite limited)

I can reproduce the behaviour with the fedora qemu arm emulation. But I&apos;m a little bit unfamiliar with fedora, it seems I didn&apos;t get all dependencies for 
aclocal/autoheader/autoconf by simply running &quot;yum-builddep cyrus-imapd&quot; for building from git (which seems consequent if they use a preconfigured 2.4 tar-ball). So at first I used the preconfigured source dir from the debian machine, running configure and make and make install on the fedora machine. 

Behaviour is the same like with the debian arm machine: 

[root@localhost cyrus-imapd]# cyradm -u cyrus localhost
Password: 
localhost.localdomain&gt; lm
localhost.localdomain&gt; cm mbox1
localhost.localdomain&gt; lm
localhost.localdomain&gt; cm mbox1
createmailbox: System I/O error
localhost.localdomain&gt;

Then I manually added some build dependencies: 
yum groupinstall &quot;Development Tools&quot;
yum install libtool
yum install intltool

And right now I&apos;m compiling a freshly cloned cyrus git-version. With aclocal/autoheader/autoconf/autoreconf ran on the fedora machine. (To rule out the possibility of some error while creating configs on debian...)

Btw. on all machines simply running autoconf is not enough. The configure script then stops with:
configure: error: cannot find install-sh, install.sh, or shtool in &quot;.&quot; &quot;./..&quot; &quot;./../..&quot;

So I&apos;m running &quot;autoreconf -f -i -Wall,no-obsolete&quot; to get a working configure script!? Wrong?</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;m using 2.4.17 from kolab 3.1 source repositories right now, it&apos;s working fine. And there&apos;s also an official debian package (2.4.16), I think that is also working fine.

I tried to upgrade to 2.5.git in the past (with upgrading from kolab 3.1 to kolab 3.2; last year?) but that was horrible broken for me, so I reverted back to use cyrus-imapd-2.4 and wait some time (because 2.5 is still in development and I do not know if it&apos;s simply my fault by compiling it the wrong way...).</thetext>

            <thetext>Because I do not see a way to add files here in bugzilla, I&apos;ve added a file with step by step instructions to reproduce it in the kolab bugtracker:
https://issues.kolab.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3791

it&apos;s not formatted and barely readable, but I hope it will do the trick for more experienced users...

Sorry for cross-linking, but I do not know how to do it better!?

btw: I&apos;m using git clone without selecting a special branch/tag/commit, so in case the bug is already fixed in git it won&apos;t show it... ;-)</thetext>

            <thetext>So there&apos;s a bunch of things going to git right now, so I&apos;ll get you to test again once we&apos;ve done those.

Given our time constraints this week, we&apos;ll probably release an Alpha without being able to look at this, but we&apos;ll definitely try to find out what&apos;s wrong before releasing.

I&apos;ve targetted this bug for 2.5-next, so it will stay on our radar.</thetext>

            <thetext>Today I tried it another time. And it seems to be fine now. At least creating mailboxes is fine now:

root@kolab33test:~# cyradm -u cyrus localhost
Password: 
localhost&gt; cm mbox1
localhost&gt; lm
mbox1 (\HasNoChildren)  
localhost&gt; cm mbox1
createmailbox: Mailbox already exists

:-)

Comments: 

- I don&apos;t know which commit fixes this. For me this doesn&apos;t matter as long as it is really fixed now. ;-)

- I had to add two new dependencies which rises errors while compiling (./configure doesn&apos;t check for those!): apt-get install libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libical0 libical-dev

btw, not related to this bug: I haven&apos;t configured sqlite3-support, so the hard dependency on sqlite seems odd to me. (Database support: [...] sqlite: no)
And libical as a hard dependency? ...</thetext>

            <thetext>While creating a mailbox works now, it&apos;s still not working on arm for me. A freshly created mailbox has an &quot;invalid format&quot;:
