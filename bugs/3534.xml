            <thetext>I have found an issue with saslauthd, it appears to let a user authenticate with any password if the users password is blank in the /etc/shadow file on the smtp service.

Environment:

Opensuse 11.4
rpm -qa cyrus-sasl
cyrus-sasl-2.1.23-15.1.x86_64

#/etc/sysconfig/saslauthd
SASLAUTHD_AUTHMECH=shadow

# id sasltest
uid=1001(sasltest) gid=100(users) groups=33(video),100(users)


# testsaslauthd -u sasltest -p test  -s smtp
0: OK &quot;Success.&quot;

# testsaslauthd -u sasltest -p wrongtest  -s smtp
0: NO &quot;authentication failed&quot;

# grep sasltest /etc/shadow
sasltest:$2y$10$RlSnCi99SDDFguMNk.rhcurpXphwm.NA9121vnVFi5RqzgmruFKye:15212:0:99999:7:::

Now if I remove the password in the shadow file.

# grep sasltest /etc/shadow
sasltest::15212:0:99999:7:::

 # testsaslauthd -u sasltest -p test  -s smtp
0: OK &quot;Success.&quot;

# testsaslauthd -u sasltest -p wrongtest  -s smtp
0: OK &quot;Success.&quot;

# testsaslauthd -u sasltest -p icanputanythingIwanthere  -s smtp
0: OK &quot;Success.&quot;

Is this the expected result when using shadow as the auth mech ?

I know the solution is not to use blank passwords, but I would expect it to fail because you supplied a password when it does not have one or not allow a blank password. Recently had a customer being used as a spam relay because of this. I have already explained that blank passwords are a bad idea.</thetext>

            <thetext>I can confirm using both the getpwent and shadow backends, but not the pam backend.

This may not be entirely unexpected; Per the passwd(5) (linux):

       The encrypted password field may be blank, in which case no
       password is required to authenticate as the specified login
       name. However, some applications which read the /etc/passwd
       file may decide not to permit any access at all if the password
       field is blank. If the password field is a lower-case “x”, then
       the encrypted password is actually stored in the shadow(5) file
       instead; there must be a corresponding line in the /etc/shadow
       file, or else the user account is invalid. If the password
       field is any other string, then it will be treated as an
       encrypted password, as specified by crypt(3).

and shadow(5) (linux):

           This field may be empty, in which case no passwords are
           required to authenticate as the specified login name.
           However, some applications which read the /etc/shadow file
           may decide not to permit any access at all if the password
           field is empty.</thetext>
