Original code from Christophe Zbierski (AtoS)

The branch is a fork of master but the code could be backported without modifications to Cyrus 2.3 or 2.4

Nota : 
- Original Cyrus code seem over complicated. I don&apos;t see the purpose of sawone outside namespace structure.
- A #ifdef would be more appropriate (than a if) for SLEEZY_NAMESPACE
- Cyrus indent convention (mixed tab &amp; space) make git diff difficult to read</thetext>

&gt; You could find a git branch with the code here :
&gt; https://github.com/worldline-messaging/cyrus-imapd/tree/ticket/3499
&gt; 

I&apos;m tempted to set the milestone for this to be integrated to 2.5-next, so that it is 1) available in the 2.5 series and 2) documented proper.

Concerning 2), are we dead set on the settings being named list_on_user_space / list_on_shared_space? I recon the original problem as stated on the mailing list was about the shared namespace(?) Is not a disable_shared_namespace or hide_shared_namespace_on_list a more appropriate configuration setting name? I&apos;m just wondering how we can make settings both as descriptive as well as indicative of their actual purpose / consequences as much as possible.

Thoughts? Much appreciated!

&gt; - Original Cyrus code seem over complicated. I don&apos;t see the purpose of sawone
&gt; outside namespace structure.

/me has to leave the aforementioned comments to the more technically savvy developers ;-)

&gt; - Cyrus indent convention (mixed tab &amp; space) make git diff difficult to read

Agreed, the indentation convention has proven and will continue to prove a royal pain in the as^H^H tukhus.

Perhaps we need to plan for an overall conversion of (the indentation for) all currently supported branches over to a 4-spaces-per-tab type of convention, something which should be easy enough to do if it weren&apos;t for the planning involved...</thetext>

            <thetext>As documented in imapd.conf(5), &apos;sharedprefix&apos; and &apos;userprefix&apos; options apply only if altnamespace is enabled. 
However RFC 2342 doesn&apos;t define any restriction on that. It may be possible to change prefix for shared and user namespace independently of the altnamespace setting.
Thus, I propose to extend these options to disable too a namespace. As defined in the RFC, the &apos;NIL&apos; setting value disable a namespace.

ie. sharedprefix = NIL</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;m not sold on this double-purposing syntax or using the raw string &quot;NIL&quot;.  I&apos;d prefer disable_shared_namespace (boolean) and disable_user_namespace (boolean).

The whole point with not being in altnamespace is that there&apos;s no transformation (except heirarchysep, joy) being applied to the internal names.  Repurposing the prefix names seems confusing to me, both for the a person reading the configuration file, and for a person reading the code.</thetext>

            <thetext>agree that my suggestion is confusing for someone who get used of cyrus configuration. Your setting is more understable.

however this part of code is a poor implementation of the NAMESPACE RFC. I think it makes more sense to have a third setting &quot;personalprefix&quot; with the default  value &quot;user&quot; and the ability to set an empty string instead of altnamespace. It would be more conform to the RFC. It that way the raw string &quot;NIL&quot; is also conform to the RFC. But It&apos;s a big change, and it won&apos;t be backwards compatible :(</thetext>

The whole SLEEZY_NAMESPACE thing is pretty awful.

Ok - there are two issues here.

1) make 2.4 not suck if you have zillions of mailboxes

2) make NAMESPACE handling really nice for the future

So let&apos;s solve (1) and have it in 2.4.11, and then we can look at (2).  Sound good?</thetext>

Sorry for that.
Here is a fix for altnamespace : https://github.com/worldline-messaging/cyrus-imapd/commit/e18a43d2fcfdfe7680e1f04d37d1b849b3b8fb78

            <thetext>The patches that were applied to master assume that mboxlist_findall() is always called with a non-NULL namespace, otherwise the user and shared namespaces are hidden implicitly.  There are several mboxlist_findall() calls in the code which in fact pass NULL as the namespace, and the logic in the patch can break things.  In particular, it breaks listing newsgroups in nntpd.  

One may argue that we shouldn&apos;t be passing NULL namespaces, but we need to keep in mind that the mboxlist_find*() code is delicate/shitty/far-reaching and we need to do extensive testing on more than just imapd before we assume that everything is happy.

I&apos;m a little grumpy because this bug caused me to waste 2 hours while tracking down bug #3150  :(</thetext>

Hi Roland,

please see comment #18 from Ken Murchison, it seems it is not resolved completely.

Perhaps we need to take the cleanup / proper patch to a separate ticket, as to mark the original bug resolved indeed...</thetext>

Sure.
The bad side effect of hide namespace on nntpd is fixed.
#3499 should be closed.

Not passing NULL namespace is another story/trap and is not directly related with #3499. You could open a ticket for that but it is likely nobody going to fix that anytime soon ...</thetext>

            <thetext>Actually, I made the code that uses namespaces always use a static &quot;default namespace&quot; struct if NULL is passed.  I&apos;d actually like to change all the
namespace code to be significantly less verbose everywhere anyway, and NULL safety would fall out of those changes, but that&apos;s not this bug.

From memory, Ken&apos;s response was from before I actually pushed the patch.  I&apos;m pretty sure this is solved.</thetext>
