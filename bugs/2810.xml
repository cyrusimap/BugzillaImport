            <thetext>Cyrus 2.2.12 
and according to my code checks also Cyrus 2.3.3 
cannot deal with large files on GNU/Linux systems. 
The LFS support would enable the binaries with modern glibc and Linux (= the 
kernel) versions to deal with files over 2GByte of size. 
 
This is a serious flaw, because applications might just stop hard. 
E.g. we had it twice at customers that cyrmaster refused to start 
because the master.log was over 2GByte of size. 
 
There is an entry in the Kolab tracker for this as well, with some 
hints how to fix this: 
https://intevation.de/roundup/kolab/issue1172 
 
Basically off_t would be needed for all variables that give file indexes. 
And than _FILE_OFFSET_BITS could be set to 64 bit. 
 
On 64 bit system cyrus is known to work, the &quot;unsigned long&quot; in the struct 
mailbox in mailbox.h for instance will be 64 bit length. So using off_t should 
not be that hard to implement.</thetext>

            <thetext>Cyrus uses autoconf, so just adding AC_SYS_LARGEFILE will take care of
everything that is already using the proper C types.  The hard part is to fix
what is not...</thetext>

            <thetext>For the Kolab-Server it turned out that the cause of the hard stop 
and the logging was related to a logging library called fsl. 
http://www.ossp.org/pkg/lib/fsl/ 
 
The problem was large file support missing in fsl. 
I think that Cyrus might have a similiar problem,  
so this bug report might be kept open. 
However we need a new example what can happen without large file support 
(and without linking with fsl). </thetext>

            <thetext>A better example would be relating to the size of cyrus meta files, I would think.  When you can reproduce the problem meaningfully, please do open a new bugzilla report.  Thanks!</thetext>
