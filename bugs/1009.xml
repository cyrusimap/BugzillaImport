            <thetext>hey ken, this bug refers to what we&apos;ve been talking about lately.

&gt;    &gt; Yeah, we can probably do something like this:
&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; if (bestm &amp;&amp; m-&gt;plug-&gt;max_ssf &lt;= bestssf) {
&gt;    &gt;    /* this mechanism is no better than what we already have! */
&gt;    &gt;    break;
&gt;    &gt; }
&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; if (bestm &amp;&amp;
&gt;    &gt;     ((m-&gt;plug-&gt;security_flags ^ bestm-&gt;plug-&gt;security_flags) &amp;
&gt;    &gt;      bestm-&gt;plug-&gt;security_flags)) {
&gt;    &gt;    /* this mechanism doesn&apos;t have some of the security features
&gt;    &gt;       &apos;bestm&apos; has! */
&gt;    &gt;    break;
&gt;    &gt; }
&gt;    &gt;
&gt;    &gt; Thoughts?
&gt; 
&gt;    Hmm.  This &quot;more is better&quot; approach probably works in some cases but
&gt;    not all.  Maybe its overkill, but I&apos;m thinking that each flag should
&gt;    have some kind of weight or &quot;pseudo SSF&quot; associated with it.  Does this
&gt;    make sense, or I&apos;m I out to lunch?
&gt; 
&gt; It seems like a lot more work (especially to maintain) and probably
&gt; not worth it since in general these things really have to be
&gt; configured anyway to guard against active attacks.

I was bored and did some playing around.  Using the table of client-side
security flags below (taken from the source and ordered in what I
_think_ is a reasonable prioritized list), here&apos;s what I&apos;ve found:

- the &quot;more flags is better&quot; approach yields the order below except that
it doesn&apos;t differentiate between DIGEST-MD5/OTP, CRAM-MD5/EXTERNAL or
PLAIN/LOGIN/ANONYMOUS (this might be good enough however)

- if we simply compare the numeric value of the bitwise-OR&apos;d flags (M
being MSB and P being LSB), we get the exact order below.  This might be
completely dumb luck, but I think it has some merit.  In fact, if
necessary we could probably change the order of the bits without
breaking the API (since no app should be dependent on the actual value
of the flags, just the names)

Thoughts?

            <thetext>I committed the # of security flags fix, since I don&apos;t want to be depending on
the ordering of the flags to give us sensable behavior.  this is documented in a
