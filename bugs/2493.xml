            <thetext>Note: For all examples I am logged in as an administrator. 

Renaming a user&apos;s root folder preserves the quota. Example:

a create user/ab
a OK Completed
a setquota user/ab (STORAGE 1024)
a OK Completed
a getquota user/ab
* QUOTA user/ab (STORAGE 0 1024)
a OK Completed
a rename user/ab user/abc
* OK rename user/ab user/abc
a OK Completed
a getquota user/abc
* QUOTA user/abc (STORAGE 0 1024)
a OK Completed

However, renaming a users&apos; subfolder does not preserve the quota. Example:

a OK Completed
a getquota user/abc/test
a NO Quota root does not exist
a setquota user/abc/test (STORAGE 1024)
a OK Completed
a getquota user/abc/test
* QUOTA user/abc/test (STORAGE 0 1024)
a OK Completed
a rename user/abc/test user/abc/test1
* OK rename user/abc/test user/abc/test1
a OK Completed
a getquota user/abc/test1
a NO Quota root does not exist</thetext>

            <thetext>Also - when renaming this folder, it should be aware that there is a separate 
quota and not check the space of this mailbox against the root quota. Example: 
I had a user who was over quota, and I needed to rename their DELETED folder 
to &apos;Deleted Items&apos; which had its own quota. Cyrus returned with an &apos;over quota&apos; 
error.</thetext>

            <thetext>As far as your first issue, I&apos;m not sure this is a bug, since a quota root is 
a separate, independent entity from a folder.

Of course, I don&apos;t think we always handle all situations of this properly, but 
renaming a folder shouldn&apos;t move the quota root implicitly.

I&apos;m not sure I fully understand the second issue.</thetext>

            <thetext>&gt; As far as your first issue, I&apos;m not sure this is a bug, since a quota root is 
&gt; a separate, independent entity from a folder.

Then why is the quota migrated implicitly when renaming a user&apos;s root folder, 
as in user.[some username]? This is inconsistent with a quota root being a 
separate entity. Additionally, you cannot issue a SETQUOTA command to create a 
quota root for a folder that does not exist, so I don&apos;t really think they 
totally separate entities.

&gt; I&apos;m not sure I fully understand the second issue.

Its related to the first issue. If a user has a quota root on a subfolder, then 
renaming the folder will count the folder in the quota for the user&apos;s root 
folder and give back an error &apos;Over quota&apos;. Example

user.user1 &lt;= 100MB quota, 99MB usage
user.user1.DELETED &lt;= 50MB quota, 5MB usage.

Trying to rename user.user1.DELETED to &quot;user.user1.Deleted Items&quot; gives back 
an &apos;over quota&apos; message. The only way to get around this is to 
1. give user.user1 a larger quota
2. rename DELETED
3. create quota root for user.user1.Deleted Items
4. remove user.user1.DELETED quota root
5. put user.user1 quota back to original value

I think just renaming the DELETED folder should be sufficient. You could even 
elminate steps 1 and 5 if you could create a quota root for &apos;Deleted Items&apos; 
without the folder existing.

            <thetext>Sean - I&apos;m going to back up your interpretation here - quotaroots should be renamed along with the folder they&apos;re attached to if the folder gets renamed.

Either that or you should be able to create quotaroots without needing an associated folder, of course.  Which does make the special case of renaming users a bit ... special.

Particularly since you need to rename the sub quotaroots at the same time.</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok - implementation plan is to just change user_copyquotaroot to be mboxname_copyquotaroot instead, and use it any time we are rename a mailbox with a name exactly matching a quotaroot.

(EXCEPT INBOX =&gt; INBOX.sub of course)

Things to consider:

* make sure all old quotaroots are removed only after the mailboxes in them have been removed.
* make sure all mailboxes wind up with the correct new quotaroot at the end.

Basically, we want a &apos;quota -f&apos; run after this has finished not to report any bogus things left behind.</thetext>
