            <thetext>Keep track of mailbox size as an attribute of the mailbox so that size of a mailbox can be inquired about regardless of quota settings.  Store two sizes: the &quot;real size&apos; and the &quot;allocated size&quot;.  Where one is the total of the size of the messages in the mailbox and the other is the size included expunged messages that have been kept due to delayed expunge (so these would most likely be the same on a system without delayed expunge enabled).</thetext>

            <thetext>We already store the size that counts towards quota - regardless of quota settings.  There&apos;s currently no space for storing &quot;including expunged messages&quot; - I&apos;m not sure that there&apos;s a great use case for it - unless you want to decide when to clean up based on comparing the two values.</thetext>

            <thetext>Without such a count it is very difficult to report actual storage utilizations.  This can identify users or folders which are consuming a large amount of storage in expunged messages.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;ve added a comment to the file saying we want one - it will get added next time we extend the header format.  It&apos;s not a big enough change to do a full upgrade for just this field, but we can throw it in easily when we have something else to do.</thetext>
