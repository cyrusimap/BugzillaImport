            <thetext>We should make the references header have its own cache field (or maybe we just
need a hash value).  This way we can get to it quickly without having to parse
RFC-822 headers when doing things like THREAD and NNTP operations.

This can be done in a backwards-compatible way using cache versioning (if the
cache entry is too old, do the rfc-822 lookup, otherwise steal it from the entry
directly).</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;m not sure how a hash value helps, since both THREAD and NNTP need the
contents of the header.  How much of an improvment would this be anyways?  All
you&apos;re doing is eliminating a single strstr().</thetext>

            <thetext>It is somewhat questionable -- it is a strstr() against not needing it at all.

We&apos;re also now caching the entire headers, remember, so the strstr is likely to
be more expensive than previously.

I believe Larry&apos;s comments in Bug 1627 were that we would just ignore the
collisions.  In the end, I&apos;m not sure this is a huge win.</thetext>

            <thetext>i agree that it&apos;s not clear that searching through the header cache for
&quot;References:&quot; is necessarily that big a deal, but it intuitively feels expensive
for an operation that might be performed by every client every time a message is
added.

definitely not a priority since obviously things have been working ok so far.</thetext>

            <thetext>I thought we were talking about a hash of the entire header (which made no sense
to me).  If we want to use a hash for each message-id, then I don&apos;t see a
problem.  But how is this a win?  Can we compare them numerically, vs. doing a
strcmp()?</thetext>

            <thetext>exactly, fixed size, fast comparison -&gt; should speed up threading.

i&apos;d recommend  64-bit hash functions, since even a completely full mailbox (2^32
messages) would result in only a single collision.
