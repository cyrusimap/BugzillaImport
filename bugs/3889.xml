            <thetext>Just tried to build cyrus-imapd-2.5.0, but stumbled over some issues in the build system:

* &quot;make install&quot; fails in tools/vzic

This seems to only happen with &quot;configure --enable-http&quot;, the reason is that there is simply no install target in the Makefile.

* &quot;configure --enable-autocreate&quot; does nothing.
It is supposed to set USE_AUTOCREATE somehow I guess, but it does not.

* A compile error with gcc 4.8 and -DUSE_AUTOCREATE
Once I got auto-create enabled, the compile broke in imapd.c. There is a C99  construct in line 5626, but nobody told gcc to accept C99 (see patch).

* had to add CFLAGS=&quot;-fPIC&quot; for configure to get the Perl stuff compiled.
Seems the static libraries are not compiled with -fPIC on x86-64, which obviously collided with my Perl build. AFAIK most Linux distros compile everything on x86-64 with -fPIC.

&gt; 

Resolved in 2a8b5db1 (master) and 04312936 (cyrus-imapd-2.5).

&gt; * &quot;configure --enable-autocreate&quot; does nothing.
&gt; It is supposed to set USE_AUTOCREATE somehow I guess, but it does not.
&gt; 

Resolved in:

[master 11ba17c] AC_DEFINE USE_AUTOCREATE when --enable-autocreate
[cyrus-imapd-2.5 6228786] AC_DEFINE USE_AUTOCREATE when --enable-autocreate

&gt; * A compile error with gcc 4.8 and -DUSE_AUTOCREATE
&gt; Once I got auto-create enabled, the compile broke in imapd.c. There is a C99 
&gt; construct in line 5626, but nobody told gcc to accept C99 (see patch).
&gt; 

Resolved in:

[master 9c64da5] Avoid C99-isms (#3889)
[cyrus-imapd-2.5 4f79ee5] Avoid C99-isms (#3889)

Also fixed the use of an int for newquotas where a quota_t is expected.

&gt; * had to add CFLAGS=&quot;-fPIC&quot; for configure to get the Perl stuff compiled.
&gt; Seems the static libraries are not compiled with -fPIC on x86-64, which
&gt; obviously collided with my Perl build. AFAIK most Linux distros compile
&gt; everything on x86-64 with -fPIC.
&gt; 

autoconf and automake use the output of the following command:

&gt; $ perl -V:cccdlflags
&gt; cccdlflags=&apos;-fPIC&apos;;

If that does not work for you, we&apos;d find it interesting to learn about your particular perl build.</thetext>
