            <thetext>In cyrus.conf I was using two entries in the service section having the same 
name. Though it may be somehow logical that one should not do that, it wasn&apos;t 
obvious to me at the time I setup the file. The master daemon could notice the 
admin of such a failure in the config file by logging this to syslog (maybe at 
level notice) or it could even refuse to start.

Another approach could be to remove the problems that arouse when one is using 
that kind of technique. See my posting to the info-cyrus list. I believe the 
former alternative is the better and faster way.

It should also be noted in the manual page, e.g. CYRUS.CONF(5) in the SERVICE 
section.

SERVICES
    This section is the heart of the /etc/cyrus.conf file.  It lists
    the processes that should be spawned to handle client connections
    made on certain Internet/UNIX sockets.

    Beware that service names must be unique!
