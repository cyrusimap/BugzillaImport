            <thetext>The cyrus.expunge file needs to be handled by reconstruct, RENAME and XFER.

The current thinking for reconstruct is to ignore any messages in cyrus.expunge,
provided that it is readable.  If the file is corrupt, then the messages will be
added back to cyrus.index.  This has the complication that it makes it difficult
to &quot;unexpunge&quot; a single message, but this is what two-phase would be used for.

For RENAME and XFER, the question is, should cyrus.expunge be copied with the
mailbox, or should we force a cleanup (thus removing cyrus.expunge) before we do
the rename?  The latter has the benefit of keeping the code simple (don&apos;t have
to worry about potential UIDVALIDITY changes, etc).  Since RENAME isn&apos;t a cheap
operation anyways, I don&apos;t think this is a big deal.</thetext>

            <thetext>Rob S. and I discussed this and RENAME is fine the way it is for delayed
expunge, since it only copies the message files referenced by cyrus.index.  This
is effectively doing an implicit cleanup, without fixing the leaks in
cyrus.cache, but cyrus.cache will be fixed on the next explicit cleanup.

The plan for XFER is to change it to use the RENAME behavior (not copy ALL
message files, just those referenced by cyrus.index).</thetext>

            <thetext>reconstruct and XFER code has been committed.  closing bug.

if I forgot anything, I&apos;ll re-open the bug, otherwise problems with delayed mode
should be posted as a new bug
