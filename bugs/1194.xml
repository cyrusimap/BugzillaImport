            <thetext>hopefully this can be done with both servers talking to clients.

important to not bounce any mail.  probably need to leave a forwarding record of
some sort or something.</thetext>

            <thetext>Steps:
frontend triggers a move from source to dest by issuing a command to source

Source:
- mupdate DEACTIVATE(mailbox)
- set mailbox to remote in local mboxlist
- connect to destination and dump mailbox
   - destination sets mailbox as active in its local mboxlist
(xxx)
- source machine reactivates record in mupdate (though it is now poiting at the
dest server. (*)
- delete mail from source
- delete remote mailbox entry from source. (when)

If a crash occurs before (*), this can be detected during recovery and the
SOURCE should wind up with the mailbox (question: what happens if we crash at
(xxx))
after (*) the destination should get the mailbox on recovery.</thetext>

            <thetext>sending the XFER command to a backend server now does the most interesting parts
of this process.  However, there&apos;s a lot of edge cases, etc, that still need to
be cleaned up.

Notably remaining: ACLs, Recursive Mailbox, User Mailboxes (And Seen State),
setting the local type of mailbox to MBTYPE_REMOTE for the duration of the
transaction (atleast).

Still need to do rollbacks better too.

I suspect that we also want a LOCALDELETE command like a LOCALCREATE command for
the backends to help with rollbacks.</thetext>

            <thetext>this is mostly done now, except for the 3 bugs above.

and of course user mailboxes and recursive moves.</thetext>

            <thetext>so we discussed user moves and i think we agreed that it would be sufficient to:
. lock user.example (set it reserved)
. recursively move each submailbox (non-atomically)
. move user.example, along with user seen state and user&apos;s sieve scripts,
  also unlocking the mailbox

having user.example locked prevents all deliveries to example since we don&apos;t
look for any sieve scripts or anything if we can&apos;t find the inbox.

            <thetext>removing dependencies which are mostly &quot;future features&quot;.  closing bug, since it
works in the problem-free case.</thetext>
