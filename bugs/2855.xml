            <thetext>I have my system setup to deliver to cyrus via the deliver binary from procmail. This is so I can run 
messages through spamassasin before delivery.

I have the situation where a user didn&apos;t receive at least one email. According to the procmail log it was 
sent to deliver. However, I can&apos;t tell what happened to it from there. I have syslog setup to log *.* to /
var/log/all. There&apos;s no record I can find of any delivery attempt after it gets handed off to deliver by 
procmail.

I would suggest that cyrus needs to log LMTP deliveries and their status so that problems like this can 
be tracked down. At a minimum cyrus should log the connection attempt, the sender, the recipient and 
the message-id. It&apos;d be nice if subjects were logged (maybe with a level of debug?) but not entirely 
necessary.

Doing this would make a sysadmin&apos;s job a lot easier.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is sort of related to 2964 - logging specifically designed for the system administrator to be able to track actions in both lmtpd and imapd (and pop3d and...), preferably in a consistent and easily auto-parsable way.</thetext>

            <thetext>Since there&apos;s no patch here, I&apos;ll agree that it&apos;s a dup of 2964.
