            <thetext>Just worked with a user on the #cyrus IRC channel who had an issue with ipurge.  The initial description of the -f flag in the ipurge manpage makes sense:

Ipurge  by  default  only deletes mail below shared folders, which means that mails in mailbox(es) below INBOX.* and user.* stay untouched. Use the option -f to also delete mail in mailbox(es) below these folders.

But the OPTIONS section says:
 -f     Force deletion of mail in all mailboxes.
with &quot;all&quot; underlined.  This implies something completely different, and rather strongly warns folks away from using -f, at which point they find that ipurge doesn&apos;t do much of anything in many circumstances.

I would suggest
 -f   Required for ipurge to consider mailboxes below INBOX.* and user.*.
or something like it to avoid confusion.

I would supply a patch, except that the roff source from which ipurge.8 and ipurge.8.html are generated doesn&apos;t seem to be present in the tarball.</thetext>
