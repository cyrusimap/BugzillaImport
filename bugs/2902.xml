            <thetext>I have been attempting to get 2 test sieve scripts working.  The first is a
simple reject script.

require [&quot;reject&quot;, &quot;fileinto&quot;];

if address :is :all &quot;From&quot; &quot;target@example.com&quot;
{
reject &quot;testing&quot;;
}

When I send emails from &quot;target@example.com&quot; to the account with the active
sieve script the emails do get blocked, they do not show up in the imap account
they are being sent to.  However the reject message that is supposed to get sent
back to &quot;target@example.com&quot; does not get sent there.  It gets sent to &quot;root&quot;
instead of to &quot;target@example.com&quot;.


The second script I attempted to test was a vacation script.

require &quot;vacation&quot;;

vacation
 :addresses    [&quot;testaccount@myexample.com&quot;]
 :subject &quot;Out of Office Reply&quot;
                &quot;Thanks for your email. I&apos;m away from my desk, so I won&apos;t be
able to reply. Thanks.&quot; ;


This script results in a similar behavior.  When emails are sent in to the test
imap account from &quot;target@example.com&quot;, I can see the sieve script gets
triggered and an email is generated but the email is sent to
&quot;root@unspecified-domain&quot; instead of back to &quot;target@example.com&quot;

Can anyone help me understand why the generated messages that are intended to go
back to the email address that sent the email do not go there?  

The vacation script is the first one I am looking to implement for real, so that
is the one I want to get workin the most.</thetext>

            <thetext>Both reject and vacation respond to the sender as specified in the envelope
(MAIL FROM), not anything that is in the headers of the message.  What is the
envelope in your tests?</thetext>

            <thetext>Yeah, this is clearly not a bug.  Closing.</thetext>
