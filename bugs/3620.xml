            <thetext>One annoying problem has been that Jenkins has been spamming /var/log/
with rubbish exception reports about some mDNS stuff.  See

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-8647

for details.  As a result the /var partition fills up every couple of
weeks and Jenkins stops working.  Meh.  I&apos;ve manually cleaned out
the spam, again.

The fix for that bug was committed but not yet released when the current
Jenkins was installed.  There was some further kerfuffle and it seems
the dust didn&apos;t settle until 1.408.  I shall look into upgrading now.</thetext>

            <thetext>Now I&apos;m working towards adding Cassandane to the Jenkins build.

I&apos;ve installed the Multi-SCM plugin and configured the cyrus-imapd-master
project to pull both the cyrus and cassandane git repos into separate
sibling directories.

The build script now detects that Cassandane is there and will do a
temporary install of Cyrus and run Cassandane pointing at that
temporary install.

I&apos;ve installed all the Perl prereqs for Cassandane; some from the CentOS
yum repository, some built from RHEL SRPMs, and some built from CPAN using
cpan2rpm.

I&apos;ve fixed a number of 5.10isms in Cassandane and whined to Rob until he
fixed another in Mail::IMAPTalk.  I also fixed a timezone bug; one test
was in a state where it only passes if run in Melbourne.  Cassandane can
now list tests and run all it&apos;s self-tests.

So far so good.  Now the bad news.

The Multi-SCM plugin has a bug where if polling SCMs it *always* decides
that there have been changes.  So Jenkins has been merrily rebuilding the
master branch every 10 minutes since yesterday.  To work around this I&apos;ve
disabled SCM polling temporarily.

Another (or possibly the same) bug means that git-history-coverage can&apos;t
run properly because we can&apos;t get a useful git revlist with Multi-SCM.

And finally, right now Cassandane is failing at the stage where it uses
sudo to become user &apos;cyrus&apos;, due to lack of a tty.</thetext>

This is still broken.  I&apos;ve upgraded to version 0.2 of the plugin
but it&apos;s still broken.  I&apos;ve punted this to the Jenkins users list.

One more problem is that the coverage data is not being updated for
the Cassandane tests, which seems to be due to a permissions problem
with the generated .gcda files.</thetext>
