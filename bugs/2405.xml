            <thetext>This originally came in from rm55@andrew.cmu.edu.  His first email:

For some reason I can&apos;t upload my SIEVE script from home any more:

Problem #1:

  [wolfsburg.trovish.org]
  $ kinit rm55@ANDREW.CMU.EDU
  Password for rm55@ANDREW.CMU.EDU:
  $ sieveshell cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu
  connecting to cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu
  Please enter your password:

Problem #2:

  [wolfsburg.trovish.org]
  $ kinit rm55@ANDREW.CMU.EDU
  Password for rm55@ANDREW.CMU.EDU:
  $ sieveshell cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu
  connecting to cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu
  &gt; put xfilter
  gethostbyname: Success
  upload failed: referral failed

Problem #3:

  [unix48.andrew.cmu.edu]
  $ kinit rm55@ANDREW.CMU.EDU
  Password for rm55@ANDREW.CMU.EDU:
  $ sieveshell cyrus.andrew.cmu.edu
  connecting to imap.andrew.cmu.edu
  &gt; put xfilter
  upload failed: put script: script errors:
  line 20: header &apos;delivered-to&apos;: not a valid header for an address test
  line 45: header &apos;delivered

My cyrus IMAP package at home is 2.1.14 and I realize that newer 
software is available; what I&apos;m using is based on what we&apos;re using t 
the CERT/CC (part of SEI (part of CMU :-)).

I think the check that fails on unix.andrew.cmu.edu is bogus; first, it 
works now in my current script(!), and second, the header I&apos;m checking 
*does* contain an address, and all of the special casing for the 
handling of headers containing addresses is exactly what is required:

      20 elsif address :all :is [&quot;Delivered-To&quot;] [&quot;rm55@pobox.com&quot;] {

This is a header added by pobox.com to show the envelope recipient at 
the time they received the message; this check is important for my 
script in making certain decisions about how to handle messages that 
come through pobox.com.



Second email, detailing the interoperability problem:
I&apos;ve been looking at the cyrus-2.2.3 release and now understand both 
problems:

My sieve script would work if the server included:

  rfc3028_strict: no

in its configuration, or if RFC3028 included Delivered-To as one of its 
&quot;structured headers&quot;.  This is an unfortunate development, since I&apos;ll 
have to use some other kind of kludgy match were the address semantics 
have already worked perfectly for me.

And interoperability problems with SIEVE referrals are documented; the 
only choice there is for me to upgrade my client software to match the 
server.</thetext>

            <thetext>I just added Delivered-To to the list of valid headers for an address test in
sieve.y, even though its non-standard and undocumented.</thetext>

            <thetext>The first issue is basicly that 2.1 had different format for referrals than 2.2.
 2.2 matches the current standard.  The real fix for him is to not use a 2.1
sieveshell against a 2.2 server.

Since Ken fixed the other problem, I&apos;m closing this.</thetext>
