            <thetext>I&apos;m running Cyrus IMAPd 2.3.7 (upgraded from 2.2, possibly even from
before that) and found that some of my messages have NIL as a flag (i.e.
the keyword NIL appears in the flag list). I can remove that alright,
but NIL stays in the FLAGS responses.

Here is an excerpt of the session:
[...]
. select INBOX/Sent
* FLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Draft \Deleted \Seen $Forwarded $MDNSent
Junk NonJunk NIL)
* OK [PERMANENTFLAGS (\Answered \Flagged \Draft \Deleted \Seen
$Forwarded $MDNSent Junk NonJunk NIL \*)]
* 4747 EXISTS
* 0 RECENT
* OK [UIDVALIDITY 1110213656]
* OK [UIDNEXT 9329]
* OK [NOMODSEQ] Sorry, modsequences have not been enabled on this mailbox
. OK [READ-WRITE] Completed
[...]

Now, this causes some client software to fail to select the mailbox. I
think that it actually is incorrect for the server to allow a flag NIL,
but I&apos;m not sure that it isn&apos;t my fault due to the upgrading.

BTW: Is there a work-around to get rid of the erroneous flag?</thetext>

            <thetext>I don&apos;t have an explanation for how &quot;NIL&quot; got set as a keyword, other than some client did it.

I think the only way to remove kerwords from the list is to manually edit cyrus.header.  Check doc/internal/mailbox-format.html</thetext>
