            <thetext>We had a pathological situation yesterday (and obviously all this is modulo &quot;educate your users&quot;) when a user sent an email with about 1600+ entries in the To: header.

This hit a second user&apos;s sieve script that used a regular expression match.

We had lmtpds basically being timed out as they hit this and failed to complete in time.

From a cursory look at the code, it seems that the static regex is compiled for each and every address it&apos;s tested against; that&apos;s far more labour-intensive than actually running the regex for comparison.

If my summary sounds right (I&apos;ve really not read this deeply, just a quick once-over) and if you&apos;re interested, I can prep a patch that puts the regex compilation step out of the inner loop.

And obviously we&apos;ll be educating our user at the same time :-)</thetext>

            <thetext>Having had a morning to have a look at this, the regex is only compiled once per header line. Having profiled it, I think this is more a pathological corner-case with the RE library in question (it&apos;s Solaris&apos;). This can be closed.</thetext>
