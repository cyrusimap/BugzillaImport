Cyrus IMAP: v2.3.16

I have a system that had a partition removed. Our delayed delete caused a stray account to be in deleted state against the removed partition. Easy fixed but it was odd behaviour from cyr_expire that led me to find the deleted account.

Basically some accounts at a variety of domains were not getting deleted after the defined number of days (8 in this case). I left it to allow a pattern to emerge and it became clear it was all domains beginning with letters further through the alphabet than the domain with a stuck account. 

I removed the dead account from the database and re-ran cyr_expire in verbose mode and it correctly cleared out all the domains it had been skipping. It was *also* affecting the delayed expunge of messages on domains after that damaged domain as thousands of messages were expired and deleted for good.

My logs are set to info events, not debug and nothing was reported in the logs when cyr_expire exited abnormally. So anyone in a similar situation could have their disk space slowly eroded filling up with deleted accounts and expired messages.

Logs for the message expiry:

Before fixing the dead account:
Apr  6 12:15:59 cyr_expire[22735]: Expunged 0 out of 20231 messages from 520 mailboxes

After:
Apr  6 13:00:06 cyr_expire[1837]: Expunged 28834 out of 75122 messages from 1210 mailboxes

Hope this helps
