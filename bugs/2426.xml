            <thetext>I have a mailbox that needs to store it&apos;s messages and forward a copy on 
to an external address.  my test of this procedure on 2.1.15 works fine 
using Squirrelmail&apos;s avelsieve plugin/editor.  However, uploading the 
same filter to the new server (2.2.3) breaks mail delivery completely 
and yields the following:

stat=Deferred: 451 lmtpd: didn&apos;t exec() sendmail?!

the spawned lmtp process then runs away taking as much CPU as possible 
and has to be killed manually.

----

The problem was that the sendmail option was not set properly, but this behavior
is poor in its own right -- at worst, we should fatal(), at best, we probably
want to just fail the vacation action and file into the INBOX.  This is worth
confirming before fixing, of course.</thetext>

            <thetext>hi,
i&apos;ve recently encountered quite the same problem as noticed above.
I&apos;ve just moved from a fully working cyrus-imap 2.2.3 to 2.2.8 w/ exactly the
same conf files, file permissions, etc... and discovered that now sieve needs me
to explictly fill the &quot;sendmail:&quot; directive inside imapd.conf.
Once done i received this message in my logs:
&quot;postfix/sendmail[9861]: fatal: parameter max_idle: bad time unit: -f&quot;
the sieve mail is not sent and the smptd process dies.
The problem is that i don&apos;t use sendmail but postfix; i thought it was just a
program parameter annoyance and removed the reference to this switch in the
source (don&apos;t remember the c file) before compiling.
I now don&apos;t get this anymore but smtpd still hangs.

this is really strange that i didn&apos;t get any problem before upgrading to 2.2.8

this &quot;smtp sieve bug&quot; has to be confirmed but i doubt it&apos;s a configuration
problem unless imapd.conf/cyrus.conf syntax changed between these 2 versions.</thetext>

            <thetext>sorry WRONG bug report: was in fact tls-patch for postfix that caused this
problem; sieve is working the way it should.</thetext>
