            <thetext>During transfers of mails containing multiple attachments, several of the attachments get corrupted.
The corruption appears to be either missing sections of mime, or additional sections from other places.
The bug has been seen all the way upto IMAP 2.3.3 on SLES9 ,when used with apple mail program 
under osx 10.4.x

The corruption is tno network based, but occurs during teh transfer of data between the client &amp; the 
imap server.
It can only be duplicated with apple mail 2.1.

Apple engineering had the bug assigned , and have been provided with examples of the data before &amp; 
after corruption as well as a server account with wich to duplicate the problem.

After a year of looking into the problem apple engineering assure me of the following:

            <thetext>When you say that this occurs during transfer of messages, are you talking about
IMAP APPEND or IMAP COPY or are you talking about SMTP/LMTP?</thetext>

            <thetext>Specifically it appears when  you connect to a mail box and download any NEW  message with more than 1 
attachment.

I don&apos;t know enougth about imap to know what function it is.

But the  clients are all set for IMAP access, and the message and attachment is good on the server.
The anoying thing is that it only appears to do it with apple mail</thetext>
