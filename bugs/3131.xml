            <thetext>I am experiencing the same symptoms from bug #3128, but I&apos;m not convinced that it&apos;s a file-locking problem per se.

I have an OS X Server 10.5.6 box running &quot;Cyrus IMAP4 v2.3.8-OS X Server 10.5&quot; with about 250 employees all trying to connect via IMAP.  Several times a day, the server becomes basically unresponsive with the following behaviours:

* all the IMAP clients get disconnected from the server

* no new IMAP clients are accepted

* imapd appears to be running many processes as if it were still connected to each of the users

* postfix starts returning &quot;Undelivered Mail Returned to Sender&quot; messages back out to non-local accounts with errors about [Command time limit exceeded:  &quot;/usr/bin/cyrus/bin/deliver&quot;]

* Negligible CPU / disk / network usage.  The box appears idle.

* /var/log/mail.log contains entries such as:

Jan  9 15:41:51 office postfix/pipe[19647]: warning: pipe_command_read: read time limit exceeded

Jan  9 15:41:51 office postfix/pipe[21213]: warning: open active 1223821B39FB: No such file or directory

Jan  9 15:42:15 office postfix/pipe[19673]: warning: pipe_command_write: write time limit exceeded


What debugging information can I provide to help resolve this problem!?!?</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Nathan,

What does the imapd log say?  I assume you have Cyrus logging to syslog somewhere.
Any syslog entries are helpful.

I haven&apos;t seen behaviour like this before, but my instincts are pointing at something pretty central like the mailboxes.db being locked by a single process, and everything else waiting on those locks.

Oh, and a copy of your imapd.conf would be handy too.

Thanks,

Bron.</thetext>

            <thetext>The root of my problem turned out to be OS X Server&apos;s problem:

http://lists.apple.com/archives/macos-x-server/2009/Jan/msg00461.html

In a nutshell, launchd and the kernel both have limits of the maximum number of processes per user defaulting to 266 and the maximum number of processes overall limited to 532 by default.

The link above has details on how to raise that to 2500, which is unfortunately the hard-coded limit in the Xnu kernel that OS X raises.  I&apos;ve filed bugs for both raising the defaults and the hard-coded limit with Apple.  In the meantime, raising the limits to 2500 will raise the mail-serving capacity of OS X Server by an order of magnitude (which isn&apos;t saying a whole lot, unfortunately, but at least it&apos;s enough for my current organization&apos;s size).</thetext>

&gt; ... Xnu kernel that OS X raises.  ...

I meant &quot;that OS X uses.&quot;
