            <thetext>Following upgrade from Cyrus-IMAP 2.3.15 to 2.4.7 delivery of messages to specified mailboxes has stopped working.

Investigations would indicate that the authorization ID specified as a &quot;-a&quot; parameter to Cyrus &quot;deliver&quot; is being ignored.

System configuration information:

configdirectory: /srv/mail/cyrus
partition-default: /srv/mail/cyrus/mail
admins: cyrus
sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
altnamespace: yes
unixhierarchysep: yes

This uses &quot;altnamespace&quot; to give folders at the same level as INBOX and uses
&quot;unixhierarchysep&quot; to give folder separator of &quot;/&quot; rather than &quot;.&quot; (the &quot;.&quot; is used in some folder names).

This configuration worked fine for a very long time until the upgrade.

The ACLs in place (for the auth id specified on &quot;deliver&quot;):

localhost.localdomain&gt; lm user/john
user/john (\HasChildren)
localhost.localdomain&gt; lm user/john/folder.name/subfolder
user/john/folder.name/subfolder (\HasChildren)
localhost.localdomain&gt; lam user/john/folder.name/subfolder
john lrswipcda
localhost.localdomain&gt; lam user/john
john lrswipcda
localhost.localdomain&gt;

So cyradm lam shows folder.name/subfolder has p rights (amongst others) for 
user john.

I have tested by applying &quot;anyone p&quot; to the ACL for some mailbox folders:

localhost.localdomain&gt; sam user/john anyone p
localhost.localdomain&gt; lam user/john
john lrswipcda
anyone p

localhost.localdomain&gt; sam user/john/folder.name/subfolder anyone p
localhost.localdomain&gt; lam user/john/folder.name/subfolder
john lrswipcda
anyone p

Initially on doing the above I thought &quot;anyone p&quot; made no difference but since then it works with &quot;anyone p&quot; in place (probably late night testing!). 

I have now been able to switch the behaviour on/off by adding/removing &quot;anyone p&quot; from specific folders. I will do more testing however and report back.

Some mailbox folders have periods in the names, others don&apos;t. 

The folder list is sane in imap client. Everything is working fine 
except delivery into folders. All mail already delivered prior to 
upgrade is in folders and perfectly readable as I would expect.

My procmail log reports like this:
procmail: Executing 
&quot;/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver,-r,xxx@xxx.com,-a,john,-m,folder.name/subfolder,john&quot;

To test from command line I used this command
/usr/cyrus/bin/deliver -r xxx@xxx.com -a john,-m folder.name/subfolder john &lt; testmessage

I will perform further tests to be sure, I will check
* the problem exists for all folders (regardless of the presence of periods).
* adding &quot;anyone p&quot; to any folder allows delivery to that folder.
* removing &quot;anyone p&quot; from any folder causes mail to deliver to INBOX.

Please let me know if I can provide any more information.

            <thetext>Tested again this evening and can confirm that

            <thetext>We are experiencing the same bug in 2.4.8. 

For users with spam-filtering activated we use exim to call the &quot;deliver&quot;-program with the &quot;-m&quot; and &quot;-a&quot; options to make a delivery to a &quot;spam&quot;-mailbox, and this does not work after upgrading to 2.4.8. I.e. the delivery is done to the inbox, unless an ACL with &quot;anyone p&quot; is set.

A workaround/patch for this bug would be appreciated.</thetext>

            <thetext>We worked around this by letting exim deliver via lmtp over tcp instead of using
deliver(1) and a lmtp socket. This was done by adding:
   lmtp          cmd=&quot;lmtpd -a&quot; listen=&quot;IP:lmtp&quot; prefork=2
to cyrus.conf and rerouting spam mails from username@domain to 
username+spam@domain, and thus let lmtpd implicitly deliver it to the 
user.username.spam folder.

This solution does not require &quot;anyone p&quot; on the spam folder.</thetext>

            <thetext>Can you please test with 2.4.9.  I believe this was fixed by:&apos;

Bug #3438 - offer &quot;AUTH&quot; capability even if preauthed
