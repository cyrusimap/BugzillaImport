            <thetext>I can&apos;t see anything that suggests we don&apos;t actually support the full thing.  The only potential issue is uppercasing of subject for sort purposes, which I&apos;ve patched in to Master, and can backport to stable easily enough.</thetext>

            <thetext>Sorry but you missed the point.
Please read again http://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/pipermail/cyrus-devel/2010-September/001584.html

Unfortunately Cyrus is not actually RFC5256 compliant and end users will immediately notice it with RFC5957 SORT=DISPLAY

I understand that a patch is not that easy to really implement RFC5256 in Cyrus (because of needed change in cache structure) but let me know if I can help somehow.</thetext>

Sorry - I tried to reply via email the other, but that&apos;s not set up yet.

I&apos;m still not convinced - I read the charset translation code, and it keeps non-ASCII stuff as utf-8 just fine.  The only issue is that it lowercases rather
than uppercases that I can see.

There are also a few special case translations:

lib/charset/unifix.txt

I could be convinced that these are wrong:

# Map s-zet to &quot;ss&quot;
00DF;LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S;Ll;0;L;0073 0073;;;;N;;German;;;

# Map ae to &quot;ae&quot;
00E6;LATIN SMALL LETTER AE;Ll;0;L;0061 0065;;;;N;LATIN SMALL LETTER A E;;00C6;;00C6

# Map Eth and Thorn to &quot;th&quot;
00F0;LATIN SMALL LETTER ETH;Ll;0;L;0074 0068;;;;N;;Icelandic;00D0;;00D0
00FE;LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN;Ll;0;L;0074 0068;;;;N;;Icelandic;00DE;;00DE

# Map oe ligature to &quot;oe&quot;
0153;LATIN SMALL LIGATURE OE;Ll;0;L;006F 0065;;;;N;LATIN SMALL LETTER O E;;0152;;0152


(and a few others)


Other than that, have you actually tested with 2.4, or are you assuming it&apos;s the same?  Can you give me some real test cases that I can build a test suite with?</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for your concern.
Yes tested with 2.4
A very simple use case is for example : To: =?iso-8859-1?Q?z=E9lec?= &lt;bidon@squeeze-cyrus&gt;
This is stored in Cyrus cache like this : zelec &lt;bidon@squeeze-cyrus&gt;
And of course the sort with zelec is false because we lost the acute on the second letter.
This is not compliant with  RFC5256 &quot;the SORT and THREAD extensions MUST collate strings according to the i;unicode-casemap collation&quot;

What is actually implemented in Cyrus with  lib/charset/unifix.txt seem to be RFC4790.
What is needed by RFC5256 is RFC5051
As you can see in RFC5051 there is much more special case. See: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt

All this seem a bit scary but implementation of RFC5957 make all this more clear with very simple use case.
(RFC5957 need RFC5255 wich need 5051)</thetext>

&gt; (RFC5957 need RFC5255 wich need 5051)

I have a working 5051.

My reading of 5255 means we can now advertise I18NLEVEL=1.  Actually, no - we can&apos;t.  Dammit.  I need to make the sort work correctly with two separate groups of sorting - which means a flag value.  Oh well.

It looks to me like we will be able to declare full RFC5957 support without actually doing I18NLEVEL=2, but we would be advised to make sure our comparison routines can be extended later.

But - this is definitely the right choice going forwards.  We will store strings in pure UTF-8 in the cyrus.cache file.  It will require a new cache file format number, which will specify that they&apos;re in the new format.  It will also require handling search and sort differently, but that&apos;s the future for you.

I haven&apos;t pushed this code to master yet, and I won&apos;t be creating another stable URI for it, so I won&apos;t put any URI in this bug.  I&apos;ll push it once I have the rest of the picture (cache version, comparator) finished.</thetext>
