            <thetext>When there are a large number of entries in a branch of the quota hierarchy which share a common set of leading characters in the usernames and a new entry is created which matches the common set of leading characters exactly, the user cannot be replicated to the sync server, as synchronization stalls until the associated &quot;USER&quot; record is removed from the replication log, and the user&apos;s inbox cannot be deleted from the sync client without crashing the IMAP process handling the delete.

Example:

There are 51 users ranging from aa0 to aa50 all of which have a quota on their inbox (mailboxes user.aa0, user.aa1, ..., and quota/a/user.aa0, quota/a/user.aa1, ...).

Replication is active.

Creating a user aa (cm user.aa) on the sync client causes replication to fail repeatedly with various errors on the sync server until the &quot;USER aa&quot; record is removed from the replication log.

Deleting the mailbox (&quot;sam user.aa cyrus all&quot;, &quot;dm user.aa&quot;) from the sync client causes various errors on the sync client.

Although these appear to be two different problems, it&apos;s likely they have the same cause and they are definitely remedied using the same method.  Therefore I think it&apos;s appropriate to include the entire discussion in one report. 

The deletion problem can be reproduced in a standalone environment using the following configuration:

Vanilla cyrus-imapd-2.3.13.tar.gz installation.

Empty, initialized config directory and mail store.

The following configs:

/etc/imapd.conf:

configdirectory: /var/lib/imap
partition-default: /var/spool/imap
admins: cyrus
hashimapspool: true

sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
allowplaintext: yes



/etc/cyrus.conf:

START {
  recover       cmd=&quot;ctl_cyrusdb -r&quot;
}

SERVICES {
  imap          cmd=&quot;imapd&quot; listen=&quot;imap&quot; prefork=0 maxchild=1
}


Testing was performed on a Dell 2850 server running RHEL AS 4.6, an Optiplex 745 workstation running RHEL AS 4.6, a VMware server running RHEL AS 4.6, and a VMware server running RHEL AS 5.2.



On RHEL AS 5.2:

Cyrus was started.

/var/lib/imap/ and /var/spool/imap were populated with the command:

seq 0 50 | xargs --replace=num echo -e &quot;cm user.aanum\nsq user.aanum&quot; | cyradm -user cyrus localhost


The following cyradm commands were issued while gdb was attached to the imapd process serving the cyradm instance:

cm user.aa
sam user.aa cyrus all
dm user.aa


The last command (dm user.aa) produced the unexpected response:

deletemailbox:

by itself on one line.

An error similar to the following, a stack trace, and a memory map were output on the terminal from which /usr/cyrus/bin/master was launched:

*** glibc detected *** imapd: double free or corruption (!prev): 0x088f4408 ***

Output similar to the following was displayed on the terminal running gdb:

Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
[Switching to Thread -1208641840 (LWP 31256)]
0x00efd402 in __kernel_vsyscall ()


The second time those same &quot;cm&quot;, &quot;sam&quot;, and &quot;dm&quot; commands were issued, there was no output on the terminal from which /usr/cyrus/bin/master was launched, and gdb output something similar to following:

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread -1209076016 (LWP 31279)]
0x00ba9253 in _int_malloc () from /lib/libc.so.6


On RHEL AS 4.6:

The same setup and steps described above were used.

The same behavior was observed except there was no stack trace or memory map on the terminal from which /usr/cyrus/bin/master was launched.


The observed failures disappeared after &quot;quota_db&quot; was changed from &quot;quotalegacy&quot; to &quot;skiplist&quot; and the same sequence of steps were followed.


Replication was tested using RHEL AS 4.6 as the client and RHEL AS 5.2 as the server both were running on VMware servers.

Vanilla cyrus-imapd-2.3.13.tar.gz installations on both servers.

Empty, initialized config directory and mail store on both servers.

The following configs were used on the sync client:

/etc/imapd.conf:

configdirectory: /var/lib/imap
partition-default: /var/spool/imap
admins: cyrus
hashimapspool: true

sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
allowplaintext: yes

guid_mode: sha1
sync_host: some.ip.add.ress
sync_authname: cyrus
sync_password: somepassword
sync_log: 1


/etc/cyrus.conf:

START {
  recover       cmd=&quot;ctl_cyrusdb -r&quot;
  syncclient    cmd=&quot;sync_client -r&quot;
}

SERVICES {
  imap          cmd=&quot;imapd&quot; listen=&quot;imap&quot; prefork=0 maxchild=1
}



The following configs were used on the sync server:


/etc/imapd.conf:

configdirectory: /var/lib/imap
partition-default: /var/spool/imap
admins: cyrus
hashimapspool: true

sasl_pwcheck_method: saslauthd
sasl_mech_list: PLAIN
allowplaintext: yes



/etc/cyrus.conf:

START {
  recover       cmd=&quot;ctl_cyrusdb -r&quot;
}

SERVICES {
  imap          cmd=&quot;imapd&quot; listen=&quot;imap&quot; prefork=0 maxchild=1
  syncserver    cmd=&quot;sync_server&quot; listen=&quot;csync&quot;
}



Cyrus was started on both servers.

/var/lib/imap/ and /var/spool/imap were populated on the sync client with the command:

seq 0 50 | xargs --replace=num echo -e &quot;cm user.aanum\nsq user.aanum&quot; | cyradm -user cyrus localhost

Confirmed that everything replicated to the sync server.

The following cyradm commands were issued on the sync client while tailing the log on the sync server:

cm user.aa

An error similar to the following, a stack trace, and a memory map were output on the terminal from which /usr/cyrus/bin/master was launched on the sync server:

*** glibc detected *** sync_server: corrupted double-linked list: 0x081a9fe8 ***


The following abnormal messages appeared in log on the sync server:

Jan  7 21:15:38 cyrus-test-as5 master[4142]: process 4145 exited, signaled to death by 6
...
Jan  7 21:15:44 cyrus-test-as5 master[4142]: process 4155 exited, signaled to death by 11
...
Jan  7 21:15:50 cyrus-test-as5 master[4142]: process 4156 exited, signaled to death by 11
...

The first message (&quot;death by 6&quot;) occurred at the same time that the glibc error was output on the terminal from which /usr/cyrus/bin/master was launched.  There were no glibc (or any other errors) output on the terminal when the subsequent messages (&quot;death by 11&quot;) appeared in the log; the sync server process was probably segfaulting at this point.

Other IMAP operations performed on the sync client failed to replicate to the sync server until the &quot;USER aa&quot; record was removed from the sync log.

The failures were eliminated by switching the &quot;quota_db&quot; from &quot;quotalegacy&quot; to &quot;skiplist&quot; on the sync server.</thetext>
