            <thetext>LSUB against the murder will return nonexistant mailboxes.  some clients will
deal better than others with this, and it probably should just be avoided.

fix: the proxyd needs to interpret the LSUB responses coming back and modify
them accordingly (remove nonexistant ones; maybe add/delete flags?)

this is somewhat more complicated if you worry about LSUB &quot;&quot; %.
eventually where subscriptions are kept should be rethought.</thetext>

            <thetext>The flag we want to pass back with the nonexistant mailboxes is &quot;\Noselect&quot;,
which implies that the mailbox is not available to be selected. (RFC2060).  We
also can&apos;t pass back either &quot;\Marked&quot; or &quot;\Unmarked&quot; with this flag.

The basic conclusion we reached after discussing this is that the proxyd&apos;s
should parse the incoming LSUB responses, and check that each mailbox exists on
the murder (using its local database), and tag them as &quot;\Noselect&quot; if needed.</thetext>

            <thetext>it&apos;s the general consensus of imap people that \Noselect doesn&apos;t mean the same
thing in LSUB listings that it does in LIST. crispin&apos;s latest draft might have
more info on this (see section 6.3.9).

hmm, but it doesn&apos;t contradict what you&apos;re proposing so we should be ok.
Cyrus never returns \Marked or \Unmarked so we might not care about that.

            <thetext>further clarification:

the draft says:

      A special situation occurs when using LSUB with the % wildcard.
      Consider what happens if &quot;foo/bar&quot; (with a hierarchy delimiter of
      &quot;/&quot;) is subscribed but &quot;foo&quot; is not.  A &quot;%&quot; wildcard to LSUB must
      return foo, not foo/bar, in the LSUB response, and it MUST be
      flagged with the \Noselect attribute.  

Which, while not what we want to do, does not exclude what we want to do.</thetext>
