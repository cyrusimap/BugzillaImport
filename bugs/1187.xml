            <thetext>Would be nice to have a basic, (even if read-only) implementation of
annotatemore.

server).</thetext>

            <thetext>design question:

how should we store the data in the database?

1. should we store the annotate entry as the db key, with all of the annotate
attrib-value pairs as the db value?

2. should we append each attribute name to the entry name to form the key and
store just the attrub value as the db value?

3. ???


my understanding of the draft leads me to believe that we need to search on both
the entry name and attrib name.  what&apos;s the best architecture to faciliate this?</thetext>

            <thetext>should i continue to persue this?  i know larry wasn&apos;t thrilled with the idea 
of read/write annotations.  i have a strawman for read-only mailbox annotations 
already in CVS.</thetext>

            <thetext>[changing my CC.]

i think we&apos;re going to need some read-only annotations for our murder deployment
at CMU; otherwise our user services people will probably kill us.  (we need to
support an &quot;info&quot; command or something from cyradm to find out where a mailbox
actually is.)

so is this just a matter of testing right now?

            <thetext>The code currently in CVS _should_ return the partition info.  The attribute 
parsing code sucks because it was a quick hack just for testing.  The protocol 
piece(s) should be fine.  Its been a while since I looked at this stuff, but I 
can revisit it if you like.</thetext>

            <thetext>added setinfo command (SETANNOTATION).  doesn&apos;t handle strings with whitespace 
(they are parsed as separate tokens).  either we need the cyradm parser to not 
strip quotes, or we need to handle quoted/unquoted strings in setinfo somewhere</thetext>

            <thetext>Current plan:

proxys do a proxy of *all* annotation commands (they just pass data back and
forth, and don&apos;t do any local processing).

backends pass back config_servername for the server annotation on all mailboxes.

I think this is much simpler than having the proxies return the server annotation
then having to fetch additional annotations from the backends...</thetext>

            <thetext>actually, it probably makes sense to keep proxy specific stuff since you still
might have to merge results from multiple backends.</thetext>

            <thetext>this is finally resolved (pending a new draft of annotatemore that clarifies
that multiple ANNOTATION responses are allowed)</thetext>
