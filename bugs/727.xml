            <thetext>if master crashes and we are using bdb, we really want to make sure that there 
aren&apos;t any processes still alive and dinking with the database. If we don&apos;t 
kill these processes before we run recovery, things could get royally screwed 
up.</thetext>

            <thetext>This looks like a place for, dare I say it, another lock!  Of course BDB should handle this sort of nonsense itself.

I&apos;m really tempted to move BDB to a &quot;lazy load&quot; scenario, where you don&apos;t even attempt to pick up the environment until a database that actually uses BDB is requested, and you drop the environment when you close the last database.

This would mean that most processes wouldn&apos;t even need to have BDB open most of the time.

And of course they&apos;d all grab a shared lock on a lock file before they opened the BDB environment.  And ctl_cyrusdb would grab an exclusive lock on said file before it ran recovery!</thetext>

            <thetext>Bron, if still applicable after close to 10 years, could you please reopen, update the version number to the lowest possible / feasible in which this could still be implemented and target against a milestone of your choice? Thanks!

Cleaning up as part of the Bugzilla clean up exercise. Please reopen and adjust version / milestone as and if appropriate.
