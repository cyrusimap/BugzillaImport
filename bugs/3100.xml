            <thetext>Setting a flag is the only portable change that can be made in a signal handler.
makedepend/main.c, imap/make_{md5,sha1}.c, and imap/{idle,imapd}.c all do more than that.  make_{md5/sha1}.c are easily fixed -- the child waiting code should be moved to the bottom of main.  The idle_init / idle_update problem is a serious design issue.  Comments?</thetext>

            <thetext>This issue should be Priority 1 or 2. But definetely not P5. It is a very serious design flaw. We are using Cyrus IMAPD on Redhat Enterprise 6.0 and it deadlocks constantly because of this (RHEL 5 did not had this issue, because it had older Cyrus version). I guess more and more people will see this problem as they upgrade their Redhat installations. Given that this issue doesn&apos;t really have a viable workaround, it should be addressed as soon as possible. Or else people will start moving to Dovecot. I would hate doing so because I like Cyrus IMAPD very much! :)</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Ken and Wes,

it looks like I&apos;m going to be addressing this anyway, just to be able
to stabilise the autobuild on ci.cyrusimap.org, which has been randomly
failing for some days due to signal handling races in the master process.

Wes, in reply to your initial comments

makedepend/main.c
    This is utterly broken but is used only during build, and will
    soon not be used at all (when we move to autotools).  So I&apos;m
    inclined to ignore this.

imap/make_{md5,sha1}.c
    Also broken, although waitpid() is safer to call in a signal
    handler than syslog() or sigaction().  However this code seems
    to have been deleted since the 2.3 branch.  If I understand the
    policy correctly, we only do security fixes for 2.3, so this
    fix doesn&apos;t qualify.

imap/idled.c
    has some problems, I have a fix.

imap/idle.c
    this is scary, but I believe it&apos;s been causing irritating problems
    in production for some time now, so I will look at it.

imap/imapd.c
    this seems ok now - it doesn&apos;t do anything interesting in signal
    handlers, and the last few fixes should deal with some other
    lingering issues, see Bug 3648.

The worst culprit by far is the master process, and I have fixes for
that which will go into Bug 3648.</thetext>
