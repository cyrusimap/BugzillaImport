            <thetext>The notify daemon gets called for every message regardless of what Sieve says, 
because it is used for the older Zephyr-style notification as well as the newer 
Sieve-notify feature. This is very inefficient for many people using Sieve-
notify (particularly combined with unix_notify), since often 99% of people have 
no Sieve script, so the notify daemon has to deal with all these requests only 
to throw them away again. Ken M says:
&gt; So you want to disable notify for ALL users without a Sieve script? 
&gt; AFAIK you can&apos;t right now.  We can make this an imapd.conf option.</thetext>

            <thetext>i&apos;m not particularly bothered by this behavior.  many CMU users want
notifications but have no sieve script.

how inefficient is this?  throwing away notifications that aren&apos;t being
subscribed to should be a fairly light-weight operation.</thetext>

            <thetext>should people WITH sieve scripts be subjected to TWO notifications per delivery 
(one from SIEVE and one from MAIL)?  this is a straight forward fix in 
deliver_mailbox()</thetext>

            <thetext>The overhead depends on the implementation. My Perl daemon that handles 
notifications would have trouble handling a connection for every single 
delivery, but for every delivery to a Sieve user it would be fine.</thetext>
