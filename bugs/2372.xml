            <thetext>The output of
./configure --help

does not list the 
--with-sataticsasl=&lt;DIR&gt;

This option is needed for architectures that do not support shared objects, so 
listing it in the --help output would be real helpful.</thetext>

            <thetext>--with-staticsasl is deprecated, use --enable-static instead.

It would be helpful if you were to use a real email address in future bug reports.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Rob,

Just wanted to let you know the email address is funny but is actually real. The 
funny name, unknown@, is because it&apos;s used on public mail lists, in published 
source code, on the web and in DNS registrations. Though a bit odd, the name 
alone does a wonderful job of reducing spam. If you ever have a problem with it, 
you can also use mercury@ with the same domain.

As for the issue, --with-staticsasl=&lt;DIR&gt; was not marked as depreciated in the 
source and changelog states it is different than --enable-static, so I figured 
it was just missing from the --help output.

ChangeLog:
2001-07-03  Rob Siemborski &lt;rjs3+@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
	* Static library compilation now optional (--with-staticsasl)
	  Note that this is different from --enable-static, which causes
	  libtool to build static versions of everything is is almost
	  certainly NOT what you want.

Marking the --with-staticsasl=&lt;DIR&gt; option it as depreciated/unsupported in the 
source and docs would be the best bet. It&apos;s use is even recomended in docs (see 
the following):

cyrus-sasl-2.1.17\cyrus-sasl-2.1.17\doc\advanced.html

            <thetext>from configure.in:

&gt;&gt;&gt;
dnl xxx compatibility
AC_ARG_WITH(staticsasl)
if test &quot;$with_staticsasl&quot; = yes; then
        enable_shared=yes
        enable_static=yes
fi
&lt;&lt;&lt;

The changelog entry is from 2001, I suspect the change that made it
&quot;Compatibility only&quot; wasn&apos;t described well enough...  I did fix advanced.html</thetext>

            <thetext>Yep, I saw that in configure.in. It was mainly the docs/logs that threw me. I 
still think adding a &quot;depreciated&quot; line to the option description would be a 
good move since the option will probably be removed eventually.</thetext>
