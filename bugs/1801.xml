            <thetext>How do people forsee this working?  My inclination is to add a &apos;-d &lt;domain&gt;&apos; 
option and just check/fix quotas within a single domain.  Trying to add support 
to show quotas for the entire mail store or across different domains would be a 
lot more difficult.</thetext>

            <thetext>quota now supports virtdomains.  NOTE: it will remove domain quotas when used
with -f, but I think this is a bug in mboxlist_setquota() now setting the
correct quotaroot.</thetext>

            <thetext>Using 2.2.12 (patch with 64 bits quotas support), it still removes domain quotas
when used with quota -f...

Also, it segfaults easily at the end of the loop, seems unrelated to 64 bits
support as it does it with or without.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;ve yet to migrate to 2.4, and I did not really played with quotas again since that old time...

BTW, is this possible: a &quot;global&quot; quota for one domain, which can /not/ be over, and a quota per user, which checks before if the global quota is out ?

IE, say, 1GB for domain.com, 500M for user1, 500M for user2, 500M for user3, and used: 400 by u1, 400 by u2, 200 by u3, mail are &quot;refused&quot; because global quota is out ?</thetext>

            <thetext>No, sorry - every mailbox is only within one quotaroot - so if you set a quota for an individual user, it removes them from the domain total.

I can see your point - it would be a nice thing to have, administratively.  It would require a fair bit of magic within Cyrus to support though... certainly not going to go in a stable release.

Would be nice to have for users too - the ability to set a quota on a subtree
as well as a quota for the entire user.

(you can only store 200Mb of Trash before you have to clean it up...)</thetext>

            <thetext>Just tested this, domain quotas work fine with the new quota tool for 2.4.10.</thetext>
