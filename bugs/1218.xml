            <thetext>Take this situation:

client supports referrals and issues a DELETE (let&apos;s even assume that it&apos;s an
administrative client that needs administrative priviliges for the operation, so
it HAS to do the referrals)

Client issues delete to proxy server.  Proxy server issues referral to backend
server and returns to cmdloop.

Delete happens, and client issues a LIST to the proxy server.  we now have a
race condition where the deleted mailbox is possibly still in the proxy server&apos;s
mailboxes.db

suggested fix:  have applicable referrals &quot;schedule&quot; a mupdate kick that happens
AFTER input is recieved for the next command, but before that command is
executed, so that local mailbox list is consistant whenever it is next queried.

Note that this won&apos;t help if the client issues another commadn before performing
the referral.  And I don&apos;t think we want to kick on every command ;)</thetext>

            <thetext>do we have an example of a client that actually does this?

does this actually cause a problem?</thetext>

            <thetext>cyradm does this.  or rather, causes this problem (it completes the referral
before issuing another command to the proxy, of course).</thetext>
