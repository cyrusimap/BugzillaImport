            <thetext>Hi *   
   
this is a timing issue when a child (an imapd or lmtpd process) reports his   
state to the master and the child exits. It applies to version 2.2.8 and 
2.2.12. I haven&apos;t tested 2.3.x but the code seems to have no change in that 
area. 
   
I run master with CYRUS_VERBOSE=5 so i see all messages. The following is   
the output in the logs.   
   
Feb 11 19:05:39 mx2 master[1167]: set maximum file descriptors to 1024/1024  
Feb 11 19:05:44 mx2 master[1167]: about to exec /usr/lib/cyrus/bin/imapd  
Feb 11 19:05:49 mx2 imap[1167]: executed  
Feb 11 19:05:56 mx2 imap[1167]: telling master 2  
Feb 11 19:06:01 mx2 imap[1167]: accepted connection  
Feb 11 19:06:06 mx2 imap[1167]: telling master 3  
Feb 11 19:06:13 mx2 imap[1167]: telling master 1  
Feb 11 19:07:06 mx2 master[30135]: service imap pid 1167 in READY state: now  
unavailable and in BUSY state  
Feb 11 19:07:29 mx2 master[30135]: process 1167 exited, status 0  
Feb 11 19:08:21 mx2 master[30135]: service imap pid 1167: while trying to  
process message 0x3: not registered yet  
Feb 11 19:08:23 mx2 master[30135]: service imap pid 1167 in UNKNOWN state:  
processing message 0x3  
Feb 11 19:08:25 mx2 master[30135]: service imap pid 1167 in UNKNOWN state: now  
in BUSY state and serving connection  
Feb 11 19:09:17 mx2 master[30135]: service imap pid 1167 in BUSY state: now  
available and in READY state  
  
I know it is very unusual to have pipe reads this much time after the write.  
But I have no idea how this is caused.  
  
It is a Linux system with kernel 2.6.15.2. The prior kernel was a 2.6.9 and the  
behavior was the same. This system has run for one year on the 2.6.9 kernel  
without any problems.  
  
I have reduced (but not solved) that problem setting -T 120 -U 200  
  
I think the huge delay between the messages from the childs cause the problem.  
Master knows that that child died and set it to UNKNOWN state. As there are  
coming the further messages it let the master believe that this child is  
still present which isn&apos;t true (since the child has exited). As a result  
the master won&apos;t fork any childs.  
  
If you want some straces, let me know

            <thetext>The problem here is that master is reaping the dead child table too fast to
account for such a big delay as you see in your system (which, I should add,
must be somehow broken).

In the original versions of the child tracking patch (which are still in
Debian&apos;s 2.1 tree, and which became the roots of what is now running in 2.2),
there was a switch to set the &quot;janitor mourning time&quot;.  Increase it, and your
problem will be gone.

Here&apos;s the original manpage&apos;s text for that switch:
       -J janitor mourining time interval
              Sets the amount of time, in seconds, to remember a child process
              after it exits.  You only need to increase this from the default
              of 2 seconds, if you see messages in syslog complaining of  mes-
              sages from unknown or unregistered children.

I don&apos;t know if that time can be made adaptative, or auto-detected. But it can&apos;t
be too long by default, as that would cause performance issues and other
problems in very busy servers.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is bug #2647.  It is a nasty one, I will look at the patches in #2647, if
they are not current I will update them (at least for 2.2).

Ken, I really think a fix for this one needs to go into 2.2 (and 2.2.13 be
released with it) asap.
