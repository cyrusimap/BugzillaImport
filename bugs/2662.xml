            <thetext>Setquota or setacl will hang (though the change will occur if I check later with get*), and no response is 
heard back from the server.

Soon afterwards various other problems occur. 
errors range from not being able to contact the server to not being able to append the message to the 
&apos;sent-mail&apos; folder.

Restart clears things up until the next setquota/acl operation occurs

We build with
./configure --prefix=%{_prefix} --with-cyrus-prefix=%{_prefix} --enable-murder --enable-replication 
--without-snmp --with-com_err=yes

Used the cvs release for 2.3 from May 12, 2005.

Let me know if you need more details.</thetext>

            <thetext>Does it happen without replication? Basically if you can tell us what&apos;s causing it it makes things easier to 
track and repair.</thetext>

            <thetext>Now I&apos;m really unsure of the cause.

I got another server and installed the same build and it experienced no problems, though it is a 
standalone.

The servers (replica pair) I installed on originally are semi in production (so hard to keep fiddling with), 
and I was upgrading from the CVS release from May 02. I used just the replica, and tried the upgrade 
again and the problems don&apos;t occur. The only werid behavior that still remains is that all log messages 
appear twice (this started after the first update, and remained even after we reverted to the previous 
version). The double logging does not happen on the standalone server where I did a clean install.

We are supposed to get a new replica pair next week, and it will be easier for me to test with them.

thanks</thetext>

            <thetext>I have been unable to reproduce the problem. I am closing the bug.

Later we had SCSI errors on our machines related to bad drivers.  The Cyrus lock up could have been 
caused by previous SCSI issues.</thetext>
