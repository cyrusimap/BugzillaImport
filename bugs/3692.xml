Could you please bump SONAME and do a 2.1.26 release, so we are all in sync? I don&apos;t want to bump SONAME just in the Debian package.

            <thetext>Additional information on SONAME from ondrej@sury.org:

cyrus-sasl now produces:

library: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsasl2.so.2.0.25
symlink: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libsasl2.so.2

Binaries (as for example slapd) are linked to libsasl2.so.2 (which is
the SONAME) and dynamic linker looks for this file in it&apos;s paths.

When you break binary compatibility as happened in 2.1.24 you need to
increase SONAME of the library to something higher (usually just
increase it by one).

So cyrus-sasl &gt;= 2.1.24 should really have: libsasl2.so.3 SONAME.

Also as one can see the last (patch) number of the library matches the
release, which is also probably wrong. You need to change the number
only in case you actually change something in the ABI (like add a new
function).

You can read more about Library interfaces in the libtool manual,
especially this part is relevant:
http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html#Versioning

Here are a set of rules to help you update your library version information:

1. Start with version information of ‘0:0:0’ for each libtool library.
2. Update the version information only immediately before a public
release of your software. More frequent updates are unnecessary, and
only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger faster.
3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
update, then increment revision (‘c:r:a’ becomes ‘c:r+1:a’).
4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
last update, increment current, and set revision to 0.
5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
then increment age.
6. If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last
public release, then set age to 0.</thetext>

            <thetext>This should be fixed by 69495a26cacc2b7fde398ce4b3a5904b34f52888 post 2.1.25.</thetext>
