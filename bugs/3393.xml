            <thetext>I am running cyrus-imapd 2.3.16 with skiplist as backend for quotas.db file
Time to time imapd hangs locking quotas.db file - all other cyrus processes (lmtpd,pop3d) stop working as well.
It is possible to kill imapd process that hold quotas.db for write to get cyrus back to work.

output of lsof include this line for process required to be killed each time:
imapd     12159 cyrus  mem-W     REG                8,4 31406976    1988027 /var/imap/quotas.db</thetext>

            <thetext>I think this one is fixed in cyrus 2.4.x - it was a locking inversion, and we hold quota locks for a lot shorter time now.</thetext>

            <thetext>The issue isn&apos;t with cyrusdb_skiplist - it&apos;s with how the quota database is used in imapd.  It&apos;s not an easy backport, I&apos;m afraid.</thetext>

            <thetext>Dennis - are you certain that seen is at fault here?  I can&apos;t find a codepath that could allow it.  Do you have an &apos;lsof&apos; of two processes with this problem that contain the locking inversion?</thetext>

            <thetext>I don&apos;t want to keep this one open against 2.4 unless I can get a confirmation that it exists in the wild.  Dennis, are you certain you saw this precise bug against 2.4.16?

            <thetext>well, i converted one server from quotalegacy to skiplist.
size of quotas.db is 42M with ~120K of top level mailboxes.
load average on 4xcore increases from ~2.0 to ~5.5.
i will wait for lock-ups until weekend before going back to quotalegacy</thetext>

            <thetext>ok, it seems to work fine with minor slowdown comparing to quotalegacy</thetext>

            <thetext>Cool, that makes sense.  Skiplist is never going to be quite as fast as raw file rewrites with quotalegacy.  Twoskip will be even slower.

Thanks for following up.</thetext>
