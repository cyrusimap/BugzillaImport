            <thetext>Whatever I set the default domain to ends up being sent to Cyrus SASL (for
authentication) as @com instead.  Thus, for user ethanb@centeforlanguage.com, if
the default domain is set to centerforlanguage.com, then cyrus-sasl is sent
&quot;ethanb@com&quot; instead!  This means that I cannot log in as my own users.  I
&quot;fixed&quot; this problem for my own setup by creating no dafault domain.  Then I
have to use the fully qualified ethanb@centerforlanguage.com to log in (both
through service imap and through cyradm).  

Furthermore, there exists a problem with deleting mailboxes through cyradm.  I
accidently created a mailbox, however, the administrator I chose gets the
message &quot;permission denied&quot; when trying to delete the mailbox!  I had to use the
fully qualified administrator name for the domain to be able to even create the
mailbox because of the first problem i mentioned here.  Global admins cannot
function because the system will log them in as admin_name@com instead of as
admin_name.</thetext>

            <thetext>Note that plenty of people are using this code, and it is not broken.  You may
not like its behavior, but if you configure it correctly, is works just fine.

Your problem is most likely that your server&apos;s hostname is
&apos;centerforlanguage.com&apos; instead of &apos;xxx.centerforlanguage.com&apos;.  The the former
case, the code will assume that the domain of the machine is &apos;com&apos;; in the
latter case, it will assume that the domain of the machine is
&apos;centerforlanguage.com&apos;, which matches the defaultdomain and will not be
appended to the userid.</thetext>

            <thetext>You solved the first problem, thank you.  However, the second problem remains. 
I am able to create mailboxes, but deleting them gives the error &quot;Permission
denied.&quot;</thetext>
