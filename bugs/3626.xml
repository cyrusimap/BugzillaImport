            <thetext>Rename a folder in cyradm:

&gt; mail&gt; renm user.aaa.AAA user.aaa.ZZZ

Now I can see two folders on my partition:

/var/imap/data/p2/user/aaa/AAA    and
/var/imap/data/p2/user/aaa/ZZZ

from a discussion with Greg Banks about that:

---&lt; schnipp &gt;---
Hmm, that seems wrong doesn&apos;t it?

Looking in the git logs, I see that before this commit

commit eed0f295b090a3cbee5e2298001c7692fb62435f
Author: Ken Murchison &lt;murch@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;
Date:   Thu Nov 30 17:11:16 2006 +0000

    moved 2.3 code to trunk

deleting a mailbox used to rmdir the directory, and all empty ancestors,
which seems like too much.  Since that commit, no directories are rmdir()d,
not even the one you wanted, which seems too little.

So if it&apos;s broken it&apos;s been broken a long time :)

            <thetext>I&apos;m actually not sure what the story is here... I&apos;ve just done a test on master,
and it&apos;s looking pretty broken there too.  What SHOULD happen is that the rename
causes deletes of empty parent folders (no child mailboxes) back up to the top
level of the namespace, so /var/imap/data/p2/ should remain regardless, but the
rest should be cleaned up.</thetext>

            <thetext>I think I have fixed this on cyrus-imapd-2.4 branch now.  The bug on master may or may not have been separate.  I fixed a few things in the delete_rename path.

Can you give a more concrete list of exact steps to reproduce that I can test?

(hopefully I can get cassandane running against 2.4 and use the system tests that I used on master to confirm the fix there... but I ran tests by hand after patching and it seems to be cleaning up correctly now)


NOTE: if you have the folder open in a client somewhere, it won&apos;t clean up until that client closes the connection.</thetext>
