            <thetext>After migration to Cyrus IMAP customers which use POP3 and Microsoft Outlook
started to complain about random appearance of password dialogs. In the logs
were lines &quot;pop3[pid] Unable to lock maildrop for someuser: Mailbox is locked by
POP server&quot;. After while I figured that Outlook sometimes try to open mailox via
POP3 twice so it gets &quot;-ERR [IN-USE] Unable to lock maildrop: Mailbox is locked
by POP server&quot; error message. Unfortunately outlook doesn&apos;t wait for unlocking
but displays dialog window with username and password and that is why customers
complain.

I was curious why customers weren&apos;t complaining about same problem before
migration to Cyrus. That is because UW IMAP&apos;s POP3 waits for unlock instead of
displaying error message.

While googling I was unable to find any solution so I decided to write (probably
dirty - but working :) workaround which makes Cyrus POP3 wait few seconds before
displaying error message. Here is diff of imap/pop3d.c (version 2.2.8):

      char *server = NULL, *acl;
      int r, log_level = LOG_ERR;
      const char *statusline = NULL;

      /* Translate any separators in userid
         (use a copy since we need the original userid for AUTH to backend) */

        r = mailbox_open_index(&amp;mboxstruct);
        if (!r) r = mailbox_lock_pop(&amp;mboxstruct);
+
+       if(r) {
+               for(open_try=0; open_try &lt; 20; open_try++) {
+                       r = mailbox_lock_pop(&amp;mboxstruct);
+                       if(!r) break;
+                       syslog(log_level, &quot;Waiting for maildrop unlock: try %d
of 20&quot;, open_try);
+                       usleep(500000);
+               }
+       }
+
        if (r) {
            mailbox_close(&amp;mboxstruct);
            syslog(LOG_ERR, &quot;Unable to lock maildrop for %s: %s&quot;,

I think it is the easiest way for those buggy clients. Maybe it could be
configurable... Please let me know what you think about this feature.

            <thetext>It has to be optional, please. 

I certainly would not want to bog down a busy mail store with pop3 daemons that
are just there waiting and wasting resources.

BTW, I never heard of THAT problem with outcrook, usually it chokes and dies on
UIDLs, not pop3 login timeouts.  Maybe it is because I refuse consecutive pop3
logins that are less than 1 minute apart.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&apos;m instead taking 2410; If you want to do something just add a padding and let one lock be acquired 
before the other is dropped.
