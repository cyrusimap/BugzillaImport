1. BUILD SASLAUTHD WITH LDAP SUPPORT
------------------------------------

Ensure that you have the OpenLDAP (http://www.openldap.org) libraries 2.0 or
higher.  Fetch the latest cyrus-sasl package, 2.1.3 or higher,
ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/.

Unpack cyrus-sasl:
gzip -dc cyrus-sasl-2.1.3.tar.gz | tar xf -
or
tar ztf cyrus-sasl-2.1.3.tar.gz (if your tar supportz gzip)

cd cyrus-sasl-2.1.3
./configure --with-ldap  (you may need to add other options, check doc/index.html for more)
make
make install

2. START SASLAUTHD WITH LDAP
----------------------------

Create /usr/local/etc/saslauthd.conf and add the following (modify to fit your
environment):
ldap_servers: ldap://10.1.1.15/ ldap://10.1.1.25/
ldap_bind_dn: cn=operator,ou=Profile,o=foo.com
ldap_bind_pw: secret

Run saslauthd:
saslauthd -a ldap

If you want to specify a different configuration file, you can do something
like:
saslauthd -a ldap -O /etc/saslauthd.conf

For more, check 'man saslauthd'

3. TESTING
----------

First build testsaslauthd:
cd $sasl_src/saslauthd
make testsaslauthd

Run test utility:
./testsaslauthd -u igor -p secret
0: OK "Success."

If you get output other then Success, add 'ldap_verbose: yes' to your
configuration file, restart salsauthd and watch the auth syslog facility.
This should give you enough clues to correct your problem.


4. PARAMETERS
-------------

The following are available ldap parameters.  There are quite a few of those,
but only ldap_servers may need to be specified. The defaults for all other
parameters are adequate for most installations.  

Don't use quotes in these variables.  The defaults are specified within the
first set of <>.  There may be a second set of <> which provide available
options.

ldap_servers: <ldap://localhost/>
	Specify LDAP servers using uri format. e.g ldap://10.1.1.2/.  You
	can specify multiple servers separated by a space.

ldap_bind_dn: <none>
	The distinguished name to bind to the ldap server(s).

ldap_bind_pw: <none>
	The password for the distinguished name above.

ldap_version: <3> <2|3>
	The LDAP version to use.

ldap_timeout: <5>
	The number of seconds a search can take before timing out.

ldap_timelimit: <5>
	The number of seconds that should be spent answering a search 
	request.

ldap_deref: <none> <search|find|always|never>
	Determines how aliases are handled during a search.

ldap_referals: <no>
	Determines whether or not  the  client  should  follow
        referrals.

ldap_restart: <yes>
	Determines whether LDAP I/O operations  are  automatically 
	restarted if they abort prematurely.

ldap_cache_expiry: <0>
	Non zero enables client side caching.  Cached results will expire after this
	many seconds, e.g. 30.  Use this option with care.  OpenLDAP folks consider
	this feature experimental.

ldap_cache_size: <0>
	If the client side caching is enabled, this is its size in bytes.  
	e.g. 32768.
	
ldap_scope: <sub> <sub|one|base>
	The search scope.

ldap_search_base: <none>
	The base at which to conduct the search. e.g. o=example.com.

ldap_auth_method: <bind> <bind|custom>
	Specify an authentication method.  The default bind method uses
	LDAP simple bind facility to verify the password.  The custom method 
	uses userPassword attribute to verify the password.  Currently,
	{CRYPT} hash in supported.

ldap_filter: <uid=%u>
	Specify a filter.  Use the %u and %r tokens for the username and 
	realm substitution.  The %u token has to be used at minimum for
	the filter to be useful.  If ldap_auth_method is bind, the filter
	will search for the distingushed name.  Otherwise, the search will
	look for the userPassword attribute.

ldap_debug: <0>
	What level to set for debugging in the OpenLDAP libraries.	
	See ldap_set_option(3) for more (LDAP_OPT_DEBUG_LEVEL).

ldap_verbose: <no>
	Log additional information to auth.info syslog facility.  This 
	should be used for debugging purposes only.

ldap_ssl: <no>
	Connect to LDAPS typically via port 636.

ldap_start_tls: <no>
	Force start_tls mechanism through the normal LDAP port.  If both 
	ldap_ssl and ldap_start_tls are yes, ldap_start_tls will be used.

ldap_tls_checkpeer: <no>
	Require and verify server certificate.  If this option is yes,
	you must specify ldap_tls_cacertfile or ldap_tls_cacertdir.

ldap_tls_cacertfile: <none>
	CA certificate for server certificate verification.

ldap_tls_cacertdir: <none>
	Path to directory with certificates of CAs.

ldap_tls_ciphers: <DEFAULT>
	The list of SSL/TLS ciphers to allow.  The format of the string is
	described in ciphers(1).

ldap_tls_cert: <none>
	File containing the client certificate.

ldap_tls_key: <none>
	File containing the client key.

5. NOTES
--------

For better performance ensure that the attributes specified in ldap_filter are
indexed.  You can also experiment with the client side caching.  This can be a
significant performance gain.  Use the client side caching with caution
because it still an experimental OpenLDAP call.

The following configuration setting enables client side caching and it
sets the cache size to 32k:

ldap_cache_expiry: 30
ldap_cache_size: 32768

6. TODO
-------

- Port to other ldap libraries
- There may be bind problems when following referrals.  Normally this is not an
  issue.  Fix.
- Allow to specify an attribute other than userPassword for use in the custom
  authentication method.
- Add more password hashes such as md5, sha etc
- Make a suggestion (possibly another authentication method?)

7. FEEDBACK
-----------

Feedback is much appreciated!  Please drop me a note if you are successfully
using ldap enabled saslauthd.  Any code improvements or suggestion are welcome.

If you have questions, send them to cyrus-sasl@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.  Please
include relevant information about your saslauthd setup: at minimum provide
your saslauth.conf, output from syslog and which directory server you're using.
