First the reason for wanting to upgrade libtool:

*** Warning: inter-library dependencies are not known to be supported.^M
*** All declared inter-library dependencies are being dropped.^M
^M
*** Warning: libtool could not satisfy all declared inter-library^M
*** dependencies of module libcrammd5.  Therefore, libtool will create^M 
*** a static module, that should work as long as the dlopening^M
*** application is linked with the -dlopen flag.^M

Three years on, libtool knows that inter-library dependencies are supported
and creates real plugins rather than libcrammd5.a, which isn't terribly
useful.

Now the steps to do so:
- install autoconf/automake/libtool
- rm acinclude.m4 (as it contains an old libtool.m4)
- rm config/ltconfig (no longer needed)
- replace config/ltmain.sh with one from your new libtool
  e.g., /usr/local/share/libtool/ltmain.sh
- (I suspect config/config.{guess,sub} could be upgraded too)
- apply the cmulocal/libtoolhack.m4 patch, as the macro name changed.
  It may be that it is simpler to s/CMU_PROG_LIBTOOL/AC_PROG_LIBTOOL/
  in configure.in, but according to the comment I would need Solaris
  or HP cc to check that it the hack is no longer necessary.
- apply the configure.in patch. This is actually the killer: without
  it even though libtool will successfully discover that you can build
  shared libraries, and set the global variable can_build_shared
  accordingly, DO_DLOPEN won't be set, and next time you try
  imtest localhost, the capability string won't have any AUTH= in it.
  (It may be that there is a better way of dealing with dlopen in the
  new libtool, but one step at a time..)
- rm configure && sh SMakefile

Please could libtool be upgraded.
